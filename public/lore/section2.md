# Section II: The Constellian Alliance

## Founding Timeline

The Constellian Alliance formed in the centuries following the Breakpoint as a response to the fragmented state of the galaxy. Arkhalion, having survived the initial rift catastrophe, led early efforts to stabilize surrounding systems and rebuild interstellar cooperation. The current Galactic measurement of time is designated in AB (formerly YAB) for years After BreakPoint.

**Year 107 AB – Initial Naval Mobilization**

With Arkhalion's surface secured following the Great Finality, planetary leadership began expanding outward. The first task was clearing the Arkhalion system of residual rift phenomena and unstable anomalies. This marked the formal beginning of a dedicated spacefaring defense fleet, later known as the Constellian Navy.

**Year 115–130 AB – Local Sector Reclamation**

Naval operations extended to neighboring moons, asteroids, and orbital colonies. Rift activity was still present in scattered pockets, and many once-inhabited zones were found uninhabitable or depopulated. Several nearby systems previously dependent on Arkhalion had collapsed entirely.

**Year 135 AB – Establishment of Eron Vale**

A neutral territory was designated as a long-range coordination hub and diplomatic waypoint. Constructed in a system without a dominant native species, the outpost that would become Eron Vale quickly expanded due to its neutrality, accessibility, and administrative infrastructure. It later became the primary administrative center of the Alliance.

**Year 160–200 AB – Formalization of the Alliance Charter**

Arkhalion and other surviving systems established a cooperative framework to share resources, technology, and mutual defense protocols. This agreement became the basis for the Constellian Charter, the founding legal document of the Alliance. The initial signatories formed what are now known as the Founding Systems.

**Year 200–300 AB – Integration and Early Expansion**

Additional systems were gradually integrated into the alliance structure. Many were either stabilized by Constellian military intervention or admitted as trade partners under mutual protection clauses. The navy expanded its scope to include convoy protection, intersystem travel regulation, and early Rift Crescent patrols.

**Year 300–500 AB – Border Crystallization and Council Development**

As membership increased, the need for formal representation led to the establishment of the Constellian High Council. Governance structures were codified, and membership tiers began to take shape based on system contribution and integration status. Naval forces began formal mapping of border regions, and the Rift Crescent was declared a high-risk zone requiring specialized response units.

**Year 500–Present (1034 AB) – Modern Alliance Stability**

The modern Constellian Alliance spans hundreds of member systems, with significant reach in the middle and outer rings of the galaxy. The High Council now includes Founding, Integrated, and Provisional Systems, and multiple core worlds act as cultural, industrial, and military anchors. Although galactic threats remain, the Alliance is considered one of the most stable and influential powers in the known galaxy.

## Political Structure

The Constellian Alliance operates under a layered federal model, balancing representation between ancient systems, newly admitted members, and sector-spanning species or institutions. Its governance emphasizes interspecies cooperation, long-term stability, and a unified response to external threats.

### **High Council**

The Constellian High Council is the Alliance’s central legislative and diplomatic body. It consists of over 500 delegates representing three membership tiers:

* **Founding Systems**: Original signatories to the Constellian Charter. They hold full voting rights and veto authority.

* **Integrated Systems**: Long-standing members with full voting privileges, but without independent veto power.

* **Provisional Systems**: Newly admitted or partially autonomous members. They participate in a secondary Sub-Council and can influence legislation, though their votes may be overridden by the High Council.

The Council also includes representation for:

* Multisystem species blocs

* Strategic military institutions

* Alliance-wide trade and research organizations

### 

### 

### **Executive Triad**

Day-to-day execution of Alliance directives is managed by a permanent three-member executive group:

* **Marshal-General**: Oversees defense and military policy

* **Voice of Concord**: Manages diplomacy, mediation, and interspecies governance

* **Prime Architect**: Directs infrastructure, logistics, and strategic development

### **Sub-Councils**

Specific functions, such as frontier integration, Rift Crescent containment, and intersector trade law, are delegated to Sub-Councils composed of both High Council and Provisional members. These bodies review, recommend, and sometimes temporarily enforce policy pending High Council ratification.

## Core Worlds

The following planets serve as primary anchors of the Constellian Alliance. Each plays a distinct role in maintaining the Alliance’s infrastructure, economy, and defense posture.

### **Arkhalion**

A ley-rich and divine-energy-saturated world, Arkhalion was the site of the Breakpoint and the first world to resist its aftermath. It serves as a cultural and magical cornerstone of the Alliance, and remains a symbolic capital of resistance and recovery. It is home to the three major Delta cities: Silgar, Cindralith, and Aetherion. It is arguably the most important of the core worlds, owing to its density of divine-energy manifesting beings, and serving as the headquarters for the Intergalactic Wizarding Organization (IWO), which is the most powerful collection of arcane energy scholars and users in the galaxy.

### **Eron Vale**

Located in a formerly uninhabited system, Eron Vale was chosen for its neutrality and accessibility. It now houses the Tri-Spire Conclave and serves as the administrative and diplomatic capital of the Alliance. The city’s lack of indigenous populations made it an ideal location for shared governance across species.

### **Virellion**

The Alliance’s industrial powerhouse. Virellion is a dense, urbanized world filled with orbital shipyards, manufacturing megacomplexes, and materials processing stations. It produces the majority of naval infrastructure and weaponry across Alliance fleets.

### **Tarkala Prime**

A militarized fortress world in the Alliance’s northern sector. It hosts the main training facilities for the Constellian Army and is the location of several tactical AI networks and war colleges. Riftwatch protocols are often tested here before being rolled out Alliance-wide.

### **Cirellas**

A lush, agriculturally optimized planet responsible for a large portion of the Alliance’s food production and biological exports. It also produces atmospheric stabilizers and terraforming agents used in fringe colonization. The planet hosts several institutes for sustainable development and xenobotany.
