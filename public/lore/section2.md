# Section II: The Constellian Alliance

## Political Structure

### **Constellian Assembly**

The Constellian Alliance is governed by the Constellian Assembly, a layered federal legislature that reflects both the historical importance and strategic value of its member systems. As of 368 AB, the Assembly consists of four concentric tiers:

* **First Ring ‚Äì Founding Members**  
  The original signatories of the Constellian Charter, including Arkhalion‚Äôs three coalitions, Eron Vale, and early stabilized civilizations lZavros and Nymion. They possess full voting rights, veto authority, and control over legislative agenda-setting. Founding Members can unilaterally override proposed legislation with a unanimous veto.

* **Second Ring ‚Äì Full Member Systems**  
  Systems admitted after demonstrating stable rift containment, significant contribution to CAF operations, or consistent economic and strategic value. They hold equal voting rights but lack veto privileges. By 368 AB, 11 systems occupy this ring, with several more under review.

* **Third Ring ‚Äì Contributing Partners**  
  Systems that have not joined the Alliance formally but have entered into active defense, trade, or research agreements. While they lack standard voting rights, they may form recognized voting blocs. A bloc representing multiple systems with strategic weight or economic significance may be granted partial voting status on select issues, pending Assembly review.

* **Fourth Ring ‚Äì Observers**  
  Systems under IWO protection, active cooperation, or diplomatic affiliation, but with no formal or contributory alliance status. Observers have no voting rights, but their delegates may speak during open sessions. A two-thirds consensus among Observers can compel the Assembly to open a formal inquiry or hold a policy hearing on a specific issue.

### **‚öôÔ∏è Sub-Councils**

The Constellian Assembly  delegates oversight of specific sectors to rotating Sub-Councils, composed of members from all tiers, with selection based on expertise, strategic presence, or historical contribution. While voting rights in full sessions follow ring rules, Sub-Councils allow for elevated influence by third and even fourth ring systems, provided their delegates demonstrate relevance.

Key Sub-Councils include:

* Frontier Expansion and Integration

* Rift Ethics and Arcane Oversight

* Resource Allocation and Trade Corridors

* Technomantic Infrastructure and Node Security

### **üë• Executive Triad (Modern Distribution of Power)**

The Alliance‚Äôs daily operations and long-term execution are handled by a permanent **Executive Triad**, each member confirmed by the Assembly.

* **Speaker of Accord** ‚Äì First among equals in peacetime. Oversees diplomacy, intra-ring mediation, civil dispute resolution, and observer relations. Holds casting vote in deadlocked Assembly proceedings.

* **Marshal-General** ‚Äì Commander of the CAF and highest authority on defense, recon operations, and rift-response protocols. In a declared State of Emergency, their powers expand to include fleet mobilization, martial command authority, and bypass of certain legislative delays.

* **Prime Architect** ‚Äì Director of infrastructure, expansion strategy, and rift corridor development. In designated Expansion Mandates (voted upon by the Assembly), the Prime Architect is granted accelerated planning authority and priority control of Sub-Council resources.

## Currency: Constellian Credits (CC)

The Constellian Credit (CC) was established in **292 AB**, a decade after the Alliance‚Äôs founding, to support the growing logistical needs of the Constellian Armed Forces and intersystem commerce. Its value was initially stabilized through two primary guarantees:

1. **Alliance material reserves**, contributed by founding systems and tied to high-demand industrial resources like auralite and ley-reactive alloys.

2. **CAF personnel payroll**, ensuring the currency‚Äôs wide circulation across military sectors and making it immediately attractive to local economies.

While the IWO proposed a magically encrypted credit system linked to ley signatures and technomantic validation wards, **several member systems ‚Äî most notably Zavros, Virellion, and sectors of Cindralith ‚Äî rejected full arcane oversight**. As a compromise, the modern credit system remains primarily **technological in nature**, distributed through secure alliance channels but without magical verification at every transaction layer.

## Key Alliance Worlds

The following planets serve as primary anchors of the Constellian Alliance. Each plays a distinct role in maintaining the Alliance‚Äôs infrastructure, economy, and defense posture.

## **Key Alliance Systems and Worlds**

As of 381 AB, the Constellian Alliance spans dozens of systems, with its core infrastructure and institutions concentrated around a few pivotal worlds. These planets, moons, and stations form the beating heart of Constellian civilization ‚Äî politically, economically, and arcane-spiritually.

### **Arkhalion System**

The birthplace of the Breakpoint, the Divine Rift Wars, and the IWO itself, Arkhalion remains symbolically central to galactic history. Today, its surviving celestial bodies are still active Coalition cores: **Silgar, Cindralith, Aetherion**, and the battered remains of **Arkhalion Prime**. The IWO‚Äôs Bastion still orbits within Arkhalion‚Äôs inner node paths.

### **Eron Vale (Eron System)**

A once-lost world, Eron Vale was the second system liberated by the CAF after Arkhalion, and has since become the *true diplomatic core* of the modern Alliance. Its geography ‚Äî rich in riftnodes but strangely stable ‚Äî allowed the IWO to anchor a foothold here early, founding the Eron Institute atop the now-fortified mountain that also houses the Eruin Complex.

The Eron Stadia at the mountain‚Äôs base hosts most mid-scale political and diplomatic summits, though the real features are uphill on the Hall of Concord and Trispheres, homes of the Assembly and Executive Triad respectively. Eron Vale has become a melting pot of species, scholars, and soft power, with migration accelerating every year.

### **Tarkala Prime**

First discovered in 287 AB, Tarkala Prime is a strategically ideal world for military operations: high-gravity, high-density, and abundant in specialized minerals used in starship hulls, kinetic shielding, and technomantic alloys.

CAF engineers, together with Silgarian officers and IWO architects, helped establish a modular fortress grid across its continents, making Tarkala the premier training and staging world for land-based operations. Local Takal clans, adapted to extreme gravity, are often recruited into advanced infantry or siege roles. Tarkala remains under direct Alliance jurisdiction, with those of the takal who are willing to join the CAF readily accepted.

### **Virellion**

A system of immense material wealth and one of the few surviving pre-Breakpoint spacefaring civilizations, Virellion was integrated into the Alliance during the Expansion Era. The Virellionese possess robust interplanetary infrastructure, with a legacy of resource extraction, cargo automation, and void-sector navigation.

Over the past century, Virellion has evolved into a key logistics hub: CAF fleet support passes through its orbital rings, while Cindralith Trusts have contracts to operate dozens of refined mining and fabrication colonies throughout the system. The Virellionese themselves are viewed as pragmatic, highly structured, and surprisingly adaptive ‚Äî especially in technomantic fields.

### **Zavros System**

The Zavrosians, a subterranean species of stone-born humanoids, occupy a mineral-rich planet with limited surface activity. Their society is deep, layered, and religiously tied to the gods of stone, magma, silence, and memory.

Since contact, the Zavrosians have become one of the Alliance‚Äôs most respected weapons manufacturers. Their artisans produce both artisanal divine-forged blades and high-output CAF-standard arms ‚Äî a rare fusion of craftsmanship and scale. IWO liaison efforts in Zavros have been particularly successful, with several of their temple-complexes now hosting sub-academies and armament enchanters.
