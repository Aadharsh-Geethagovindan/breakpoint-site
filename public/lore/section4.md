# Section IV: Organizations & Military Structures

## The Constellian Navy

The **Constellian Navy** is the primary spacefaring defense and exploration force of the Constellian Alliance. Originally formed to clear rift threats from the Arkhalion system in the century following the Breakpoint, it has since grown into an institution spanning dozens of worlds, responsible for patrolling trade routes, responding to high-level rift events, and ensuring the territorial integrity of Alliance space. The Navy serves not only as a military body but also as a diplomatic and humanitarian force, often being the first to arrive in newly integrated or crisis-stricken systems.

Today, the Navy commands over twenty fleets, ranging from agile recon squadrons to full-scale sector battlegroups. These fleets are composed of dozens of ships and thousands of personnel drawn from across the Alliance’s many species. The Constellian Navy is widely regarded as the most organized and resource-rich naval force in the known galaxy, though it often stretches its resources thin, maintaining coverage across vast and politically diverse territories.

### **Rank Structure – Tier Types**

The Navy’s rank system is split across two complementary hierarchies:

* **High Command Ranks** govern strategic command and inter-fleet coordination. These individuals oversee sector-wide deployments, manage solar-scale engagements, and represent naval authority at the political level.

* **Ship Command Ranks** exist within individual fleets and ships. These ranks define the operational chain of command on board vessels, from the senior officers of capital ships to the enlisted personnel managing weapons, logistics, communications, and field operations.

This structure allows for consistent coordination across both large-scale campaigns and localized shipboard operations.

### **Ship Command Ranks**

| Tier | Rank Title | Role Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 1 | Helm Master | Commanding officer of a capital ship or key multi-vessel operation. |
| 2 | Vice Helm | Second-in-command; assumes control in the Helm Master’s absence. |
| 3 | Systems Captain | Oversees major departments on board (weapons, engineering, navigation, etc). |
| 4 | Line Master | Senior operator with high competency; leads specialist crews in combat and ops. |
| 5 | Specialist Crewman | Experienced enlisted crew; maintains and operates advanced systems. |
| 6 | Crewman | Standard enlisted personnel; general ship operations and support roles. |
| 7 | Initiate | New recruits undergoing active service training and evaluation. |

###  **Core Ship Systems of the Constellian Navy**

Constellian Navy vessels operate using a modular systems architecture, with each core system responsible for a specific set of onboard functions — from propulsion and navigation to communications, logistics, and technomantic defenses. On capital-class ships and high-priority flagships, each system is typically overseen by a dedicated Systems Captain, reporting directly to the Vice Helm and Helm Master. These captains form the core of ship-level command and ensure each function is managed by an expert in their field.

However, on smaller vessels — such as corvettes, patrol ships, or support frigates — there is neither the crew size nor operational complexity to support a full cadre of system officers. In these cases, systems are often delegated to specialist personnel such as Line Masters, or absorbed under the purview of senior command staff like the Vice Helm or Helm Master. The table below outlines the core ship systems and how they are typically assigned based on vessel class.

| System | Function | Overseen on Smaller Ships By |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Navigation | Handles piloting, flight path calculation, spatial awareness, and warp maneuvering. | Line Master/Specialist Pilot |
| Engineering | Maintains ship integrity, propulsion, power distribution, shield cycling, and reactor output | Specialist Engineer |
| Life Support and Medical | Regulates oxygen, climate, gravity, medical access, and emergency lockdown systems | Vice Helm/ Medical lead |
| Communications | Manages inter-fleet communication, encrypted transmission, internal comms, and relay ops. | Vice Helm |
| Tactical Operations | Coordinates strike teams, boarding parties, hangar deployment, and point-defense management. | Helm Master |
| Technomantic | Handles rift stabilization tech, ley-reactive equipment, arcane shielding, and divination scans. | Specialist Engineer |
| Logistics | Oversees cargo handling, munitions inventory, automated resupply drones, and fabrication. | Vice Helm |

### **High Command Ranks**

While shipboard officers manage the internal operations of individual vessels, the **High Command** oversees strategic deployment, fleet coordination, and interstellar military policy. These ranks exist above individual ship hierarchies and are responsible for managing entire fleets, solar system task forces, and regional sectors. Officers at this level are chosen based on demonstrated command performance, tactical success, and political stability.

Only a select few reach the highest tiers, and their decisions shape the Navy's long-term engagements and diplomacy across the known galaxy. The following table outlines the tiers of High Command and their corresponding responsibilities.

| Tier | Rank Title | Role Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 1 | Sun Marshal | Commander of the entire Constellian Navy |
| 2 | Fleet Marshal | Directs all ships within a single fleet. Oversees engagements at the system or battlegroup level. Some High Fleet Marshals can oversee multiple fleets |
| 3 | Helm Master | Highest-ranking officer aboard a ship. Commands one capital ship and coordinates with fleet command. Senior Helm Masters can command smaller ships attached to theirs as well |

### **Naval Ship Classifications**

Constellian Navy vessels are classified according to their **size, role, and operational purpose**. From agile interceptors to massive command carriers, each ship class plays a defined role in both combat and support operations. Larger ships act as command centers or deployment platforms, while smaller vessels provide precision, reconnaissance, or tactical flexibility. The Navy organizes fleets to include a diverse mix of classes, with capital ships serving as anchors and smaller ships executing mission-specific roles.

## 

| Class | Size | Role | Crew Size Range (Est.) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Interceptor | Small | High-speed skirmishing, recon, light escort duties | 3–12 |
| Escort  | Small | Patrol, escort, customs enforcement, anti-fighter coverage | 20–60 |
| Ravager  | Medium | Anti-ship combat, escort for larger vessels, flexible command | 80–200 |
| Lancer  | Medium-Large | Multi-role vessel; fleet backbone; mix of offense and support | 300–600 |
| Dreadnought | Large | Heavy assault platform; major rift suppression and sieging | 800–1,200 |
| Launchship  | Large | Deploys fighter squadrons, support ships, medical or salvage ops | 1,000–1,500 |
| Command Carrier | Very Large | Command vessel for fleet leaders or Sun Marshals; mobile HQ | 2,000+ |

## 

### **Special Forces Divisions**

While the bulk of the Constellian Navy operates through standard fleets and command structures, certain missions require highly trained, specialized operatives. These tasks — including deep infiltration, high-risk rift suppression, and tactical strike coordination — fall to the Navy’s Special Forces Divisions. These elite groups are composed of operatives drawn from across the Alliance, often trained under unique protocols and equipped with custom-built weaponry or experimental systems.

Most special forces divisions operate independently of standard fleet hierarchy, answering only to a designated high command branch or specific SunMarshal directive. While rare in number, they are instrumental in resolving conflicts that would otherwise overwhelm conventional naval forces.

#### **Voidblade**

The **Voidblade Division** is one of the Constellian Navy’s oldest and most secretive special forces programs. Established in the aftermath of the Navy’s initial expansion beyond Arkhalion, Voidblade operatives are trained for high-lethality engagements, especially those involving riftborn activity aboard enemy vessels or deep within unstable systems.

Voidblades are selected from among the most promising academy graduates and field operatives showing exceptional reflexes, combat instincts, and psychological resilience. The training process involves both physical and mental conditioning, with select candidates undergoing further technomantic augmentation through partners like **Halion Dynamics**.

Voidblade units are typically deployed solo or in small squads, functioning as strike agents during boarding actions, silent eliminators behind enemy lines, or direct-response combatants in collapsing scenarios. One such operative, **Krakoa**, is among the division’s most lethal assets, known for his relentless field record and unique frost-empowered axe.

### **Enhanced Unit Designation Framework (CEU Protocol)**

Within the Constellian Armed Forces, most military personnel follow the standard Navy or Army ranking structures. However, not all battlefield assets fit that mold. Some individuals possess innate or engineered capabilities that elevate them well beyond conventional deployment roles — individuals capable of shifting the outcome of entire campaigns. To address this, the CAF established the Constellian Enhanced Unit (CEU) Protocol, a standardized designation framework used across both Army and Navy operations.

CEU designations do not confer rank or authority within the traditional chain of command. Instead, they serve as combat priority markers, identifying a unit’s proven or projected capability in live operations. These enhanced personnel are often granted strategic autonomy or embedded within elite teams, and are evaluated separately from traditional advancement metrics.

CEU ranks are universally recognized across all Constellian military branches, and they also serve an important morale and coordination function. High-ranking CEU operatives are often deployed not just for combat effectiveness, but as a psychological anchor — reassurance that the most dangerous threats are being handled by those uniquely suited to do so.

The CEU scale ranges from Emergent candidates to Divine Anchors, with each tier denoting a broader field role, clearance level, and expected operational ceiling. While CEU ranks do not denote command authority, enhanced units can also be assigned designations within the standard military chain of command. This dual-role structure is not uncommon; many senior officers — including some Fleet Marshals — also carry CEU designations, reflecting both their tactical leadership and their extraordinary combat capability.

| Tier | Designation | Role |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| CEU-1 | Divine Anchor | Reserved for near-legendary operatives whose presence alone can shift galactic-scale conflicts. Deployed only against high Apex-class threats or catastrophic break scenarios. |
| CEU-2 | Paragon | Exceptionally powerful enhanced units who can operate independently in Class A engagements. Capable of holding entire battlefronts or executing deep-strike operations alone. |
| CEU-3 | Vanguard | Proven frontline elites. Effective against Goliath-class threats. Often lead enhanced squads or serve as key tactical assets in strike formations. |
| CEU-4 | Sentinel | Trusted field-grade enhanced units. Handle Mainline-class threats with consistency and precision. May act independently or under Vanguard guidance, May also handle low level Goliath class incidents. |
| CEU-5 | Emergent | Newly identified enhanced candidates. Still undergoing evaluation or restricted deployment. Typically paired with senior CEUs for supervised field activity |

## Constellian Army

### **Rank Structure**

The Constellian Army operates as the primary ground-based military force of the Alliance, responsible for planetary defense, rift suppression, territorial peacekeeping, and frontline warfare across contested systems. Its rank structure is designed to be both scalable and practical — capable of functioning during prolonged planetary campaigns or short-term high-intensity deployments.

While the Navy focuses on spaceborne operations and fleet coordination, the Army commands forces deployed directly onto worlds — from strike squads securing rift zones to full-scale battalions engaging in long-term planetary control. The rank system reflects a soldier’s tactical responsibilities, leadership expectations, and operational clearance.

Below is the standardized rank structure used across the Constellian Army.

| Tier | Rank Title | Role Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 1 | Supreme General | Oversees multi-planet war efforts, interstellar army coordination, and cross-theater deployment strategy |
| 2 | Campaign General | Commands an entire planetary front or a single massive regional campaign (e.g., continent or critical world zone) |
| 3 | Brigade General | Leads brigades (\~1,000 troops); handles full battlefields or region-wide rift suppression |
| 4 | Captain | Leads 100–200 troops; in charge of base-level tactical decisions in skirmishes and invasions |
| 5 | Squad Officer | Leads small squads (10–30 soldiers); handles positioning, flanking, recon, and skirmish logistics |
| 6 | Sergeant | Senior enlisted soldier; upholds cohesion and battlefield discipline |
| 7 | Ground Trooper | Fully trained soldier; core of the CA's operational strength |
| 8 | Recruit | Newly trained CA units with little experience in operations |

### **Ground Unit Structure**

Constellian Army forces are organized into standardized formations that scale based on mission scope, threat level, and terrain complexity. From tight-knit squads deployed for precision strikes to full planetary campaign forces, each formation has a defined chain of command and logistical profile. While these formations are adapted flexibly during war, their core structure remains consistent across the Alliance to ensure coordination between worlds and with naval forces.

| Unity Type | Size | Led By | Purpose |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Fireteam | 3-5 | Sergeant | Minimal unit for recon, infiltration, or urban scouting. |
| Squad | 8-12 | Squad Officer | Base combat unit for patrols, defense, and focused engagements. |
| Strike Unit | 25-30 | Squad Officer | Fast-response team used for targeted assaults or mobile defense. |
| Company | 80-120 | Captain | Primary independent deployment unit. Can operate long-term on its own. |
| Brigade | 300-500 | Brigade General | Multi-company force used for planetary stabilization or siege ops. |
| Campaign group | 1000+ | Campaign General | Full military campaign force. Deployed during planetary-scale conflicts or major rift events. |

### **Special Forces Divisions**

The Constellian Army Special Forces are elite divisions trained for operations beyond the scope of standard ground units. These operatives are equipped for rapid deployment into high-risk zones where goliath-class threats, mass rift incursions, or fortified enemy positions make traditional army strategy untenable.

Special Forces divisions are composed of veteran soldiers who exhibit exceptional field performance, psychological durability, and adaptability. Most divisions operate under direct Campaign General authority, functioning either as forward assault specialists or as independent strike cells. Their gear, tactics, and conditioning are tailored for maximum impact in short, violent engagements.

#### 

#### 

#### **Riftguard**

The Riftguard is the Army’s premiere rift-response force, deployed during Goliath-class events and long-duration containment operations. Unlike standard soldiers trained to eliminate threats quickly, Riftguard operatives specialize in endurance warfare, suppression tactics, and terrain lockdown — holding back advancing rift forces while critical evacuations or strategic realignments take place.

Riftguards are equipped with adaptive shielding systems, heavy resist-tech armor, and multi-environmental suppression tools. Their training emphasizes resisting corruption, stabilizing volatile ground, and managing population fallout. While slower to deploy than other divisions, they are critical for preventing catastrophe in rift breach zones.

---

#### **Shockborn**

The Shockborn Division is composed of close-quarters specialists and break-line assault operatives trained to breach entrenched enemy lines and disrupt fortified positions. Deployed when rapid aggression is the only viable option, Shockborn units rely on overwhelming force, kinetic momentum, and brutal precision to collapse enemy formations.

Shockborn squads are fitted with high-impact armor, breaching charges, short-range suppressors, and modified reflex-enhancing stimulants. Their arrival is typically unannounced, and their combat style is designed to cause confusion and panic. While effective, their missions often carry a high casualty risk — making their training one of the most grueling in the Army.

## Intergalactic Wizarding Organization

The Intergalactic Wizarding Organization (originally the Interplanetary Wizarding Organization) is a very old organization, with roots that trace back hundreds, maybe thousands of years before the Breakpoint. In the pre-Breakpoint era, as technology outpaced magic, they began to lose their relevance and influence.

In the aftermath of the Breakpoint, the IWO was nearly shattered. Entire divisions vanished in the chaos, and most of its ancient archives were lost or sealed. However, through discipline, reformation, and decisive intervention during the Divine Rift Wars, the IWO re-established itself as the single most powerful institution in the post-Breakpoint galaxy. Its headquarters—rebuilt as a floating space station orbiting Arkhalion Prime—now serves as both a research base and silent stronghold.

While the public perceives the IWO as a scholarly institution dedicated to rift research and arcane safeguarding, its true reach runs deeper. Through its vast network of agents, researchers, and operatives, it exerts subtle control over Alliance policy, military deployment, and even Arkhalion’s political decisions. Though never overt, its presence is always accounted for. Most notably, while nearly no one outside its inner circles knows the truth, it was a secretive IWO experiment that led to the Breakpoint event — a burden it has carried in silence ever since.

### **Internal Division Structure**

The IWO operates through a series of formal divisions, each tasked with overseeing a specific domain of arcane knowledge, application, or oversight. The modern IWO has streamlined its focus to reflect the reality of the post-rift galaxy. Each division is vast in scale and composed of multiple branches, research centers, and deployment cells spread across the known galaxy — though their most elite personnel operate from Arkhalion.

Though all divisions are technically equal in structure, the balance of influence among them shifts over time based on the galaxy’s rift activity, political instability, or scientific discovery.

---

#### **Combat Division**

The Combat Division is responsible for managing magical agents deployed in the field, especially during riftbreaks, military conflicts, or major arcane disturbances. It includes both frontline battle-mages and strategic operatives who specialize in battlefield augmentation, shielding, magical ordinance, and elemental deployment.

* Subfield: Reconnaissance  
   Focuses on observing riftbreak behavior, scouting for magical anomalies, and reporting field data. Many Tier I and II field agents belong here.

---

#### **Applied Arcana Division**

This division is responsible for the engineering and implementation of magic — whether through spellcraft, artifice, or the fusion of arcane and technological systems. Their work includes everything from mass-scale ley conductors to compact battle-ready tools. It oversees the construction of field equipment, containment fields, and arcane interfaces used by both IWO and allied forces.

This division was formed by merging the former Arcane Engineering and Technomantic Engineering branches, streamlining function while expanding research potential.

---

#### **Theoretical Division**

Tasked with maintaining the IWO’s intellectual and historical core, the Theoretical Division preserves magical knowledge, advances arcane theory, and advises other divisions on metaphysical risk. Its researchers focus on leyline modeling, rift-source analysis, and rift node mapping.

* **Subfield**: Archive & Relic Protection  
   Protects and studies ancient artifacts, pre-Breakpoint ruins, and dangerous magical texts or constructs. Many Veilkeepers are recruited from this subfield.

---

#### **Diplomatic Oversight Cell**

While not a traditional division, this special administrative wing functions as the IWO’s political interface with the Constellian Alliance, planetary governments, and neutral powers. Its members are selected from senior agents and field veterans, acting as mediators, negotiators, and covert enforcers when required. Its influence over Alliance council decisions is considerable, though always masked behind advisory roles.

### **Clearance Tiers and Ranking System**

The IWO operates under a unified six-tier clearance system, which defines both authority and operational access across all divisions. While the nature of an agent’s work may differ — field deployment, relic research, technomantic implementation — their clearance level reflects their seniority, trusted access, and scope of responsibility. Advancement between tiers is difficult, often requiring both achievement and endorsement from multiple higher-ranked peers.

Each division maintains its own internal hierarchy, but the clearance tiers are consistent across the entire IWO and are used in all inter-division coordination and Council reporting.

| Tier | Title | Role and Access Scope |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Tier 6 | Primarch | The ruling members of the IWO High Council, guiding the organization’s global strategy, research policy, and military interventions |
| Tier 5 | Veilkeeper | Elite operatives with wide-reaching authority, often managing sensitive missions, overseeing Rift-class research, or leading regional arcane protocols. Veilkeepers may issue deployment orders, control research blacklists, or serve as military advisors. |
| Tier 4 | Arc Warden | Senior field agents and researchers. Ark Wardens are trusted to act independently, represent the IWO abroad, and lead regional IWO efforts or elite task groups. |
| Tier 3 | Warden | Fully initiated and field-tested operatives. May manage local missions, oversee small teams, and serve as instructors or project leads. Tier III is often the minimum required to access classified leywork or restricted artifact studies. |
| Tier 2 | Agent | Mid-tier operatives with growing autonomy. Agents often serve in reconnaissance, field support, artifact recovery, or data transport. Requires a formal evaluation to ascend beyond this tier. |
| Tier 1 | Acolyte | New IWO personnel undergoing training or early-stage deployment. Most begin in support or observational roles and must complete multiple successful evaluations to advance. |

### **The IWO High Council**

The IWO High Council is the supreme governing body of the Intergalactic Wizarding Organization, composed of the most powerful and trusted individuals in the organization — the Primarchs. Each Primarch represents one of the IWO’s core divisions and serves as both strategic leader and philosophical steward of their domain. Together, the Council determines the IWO’s direction on matters of arcane research, rift intervention, alliance diplomacy, and internal doctrine.

Presiding over the Council is the **Prime Magister**, the highest arcane authority in the known galaxy. The Prime Magister serves as the final arbiter of deadlocked decisions, oversees inter-divisional harmony, and holds emergency powers to authorize unilateral action when time or secrecy demand it. While rarely seen in public, the Prime Magister’s influence touches nearly every major arcane initiative across the known galaxy.

Though the Council presents a unified front, ideological differences between Primarchs often shape internal debate — and the balance of power can shift subtly over time. Still, few question the IWO’s role as the ultimate authority on arcane matters in the post-Breakpoint era.

## Silgarian Military and Enforcement Orgs

### **StarSprawler Academy** 

StarSprawler Academy is the oldest and most prestigious military institution in Silgar — and arguably the entire Constellian Alliance. Founded by the divine being Gosen in the aftermath of the Breakpoint, SSA was built with a singular mission: to train generations of elite soldiers, tacticians, and battlefield leaders capable of defending civilization against the chaos of the rift.

Over the course of its 800+ year history, SSA has developed a reputation not only for its rigorous physical training but also for its moral discipline, strategic education, and deeply meritocratic advancement system. Cadets are expected to master combat tactics, leadership principles, and survival against overwhelming odds. Graduation from SSA is a hard-earned achievement, and those who bear its mark carry great respect across the Alliance — especially within the Silgarian military, where SSA alumni often rise quickly through the ranks.

| Tier | Cadet Rank | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 1 | Initiate | New recruits undergoing foundational training. Focused on physical readiness and discipline. |
| 2 | Cadet | Full student engaged in advanced drills, group exercises, and basic tactical study. |
| 3 | Field Cadet | Assigned to simulation units and supervised field drills. Begins leadership testing. |
| 4 | Iron cadet | Trusted to mentor lower cadets, lead mock missions, and act as provisional squad leader. |
| 5 | Crestbearer | Final-stage cadet undergoing graduation trials. |

### **Silgar Military**

The Silgar Military is one of the most respected armed forces in the galaxy, known for its tactical discipline, emphasis on merit-based advancement, and battlefield resilience. Founded by Gosen during the early days of Silgar’s rise from post-Breakpoint devastation, the military was envisioned as a force that would protect the weak, preserve order, and continuously train the next generation of warriors.

Unlike many other Alliance militaries, the Silgar Military places enormous weight on competence over seniority. Promotion is not automatic — each advancement requires demonstration of skill, leadership, and sound judgment under pressure. Many Silgarian officers are graduates of StarSprawler Academy, and military service is seen as both an honor and a civic responsibility.

Support roles, such as engineers, medics, and magic-wielding operatives, are tightly integrated into all branches, reflecting Gosen’s original philosophy that every function is essential to the survival of civilization.

#### **Rank Structure**

| Tier | Rank | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| AR-1 | Warrior | Entry-level soldiers who form the core of Silgar’s military strength. Trained for frontline combat and squad-based tactics. |
| AR-2 | Legionary | Proven soldiers who have demonstrated tactical awareness and field control. Often take on roles like squad leads or formation captains. |
| AR-3 | Captain | Commands independent units or strike teams. Capable of leading small tactical operations and acting autonomously in the field. |
| AR-4 | Commander | Leads multi-unit operations. Responsible for strategic coordination across battlefields and frontline decision-making. |
| AR-5 | High Commander | One of the most selective ranks. Entrusted with executing high-risk threat operations or leading entire regional campaigns. Promotion typically requires participation in an Ascension Trial or exceptional wartime command. |
| AR-6 | Grand Marshal | The supreme military authority in Silgar. Commands the full force of Silgar’s army and is considered the embodiment of its martial doctrine. Appointed only by unanimous vote from High Command and the oversight of the Silguard. |

#### **Silgar Support Corps** 

While front-line warriors form the vanguard of Silgar’s military might, their success depends heavily on the expertise and resilience of the **Support Corps** — a structured network of specialized personnel who operate alongside combat units in nearly every mission profile.

Founded under Gosen’s doctrine that no role is lesser, the support wings were formalized early in Silgar’s military development and have remained essential ever since. From battlefield triage to arcane artillery, these roles are vital.

The four major Wings of support are:

* **Medical Wing** – Responsible for battlefield healing, surgery, trauma stabilization, and soldier recovery.  
* **Engineering Wing** – Handles weapons maintenance, armor repair, fortifications, and field modifications to equipment.  
* **Elemental Wing** – Composed of magically trained operatives who focus on defensive shielding, battlefield enhancement, and controlled elemental discharge.  
* **Tactical Support Wing** – Oversees battlefield communications, resource logistics, and strategic recon support.

Each wing follows a standardized ranking system designed to reflect increasing competence, leadership, and specialization. This structure has since been widely adopted by other militaries — including the Constellian Army — due to its proven clarity and effectiveness.

| Tier | Rank | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| SR-1 | Aide | Entry-level support personnel. Undergo basic training and function under supervision. |
| SR-2 | Technician | Fully qualified support specialist. Performs core tasks in their discipline (healing, repairs, logistics, etc.). |
| SR-3 | Senior Technician | Experienced operative. May lead field teams, conduct solo assignments, or assist in complex operations. |
| SR-4 | Specialist | Expert in a specific domain (e.g., Trauma Lead, Systems Engineer, Fire Specialist). Often attached to high-ranking combat units. |
| SR-5 | Division Officer | Oversees entire operations within one of the support Wings. Works closely with combat commanders. |
| SR-6 | Chief Strategist | Senior-most figure in the support corps. Coordinates strategy between combat and support divisions and advises High Command. |

### **Silguard**

The **Silguard** is Silgar’s internal enforcement and judicial authority — tasked with maintaining civil order, investigating military corruption, and ensuring that Gosen’s core principle of justice for all citizens is upheld. Founded after the end of the Shrouded Silgar era, the Silguard was heavily shaped by **Olthar**, its first Lawbearer, whose unwavering commitment to fairness and law laid the foundation for its structure.

Unlike the Silgar Military, the Silguard is not structured for external warfare but for internal accountability. Its members act as peacekeepers, investigators, and, at the highest levels, judges for sensitive or high-profile cases. While small in number, their authority is significant — and their ranks are held to exceptional ethical standards.

| Tier | Rank | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| SG-1 | Sentinel | The basic rank of the Silguard. Sentinels patrol districts, respond to public disturbances, and provide everyday enforcement of law within Silgar’s cities and military zones. |
| SG-2 | Investigator | Senior enforcement agents responsible for handling complex cases, uncovering corruption, and conducting internal audits. Often deployed in small autonomous teams. |
| SG-3 | Lawbearer | The highest judicial authority within the Silguard. Lawbearers preside over Tier 3 trials, oversee critical investigations, and may countermand military decisions if civil law is compromised. Olthar is the current serving Lawbearer. |
