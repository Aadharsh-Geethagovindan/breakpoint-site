# Section V: Characters & Heroes

## Non-Major World Characters

### **Arkhe**

**Profile**  
Arkhe is a monk from Valkun’s Reach, an isolated city on a distant world built beneath a stable skyborne rift. He is unaffiliated with any galactic organization but is respected across systems as a wandering elemental warrior. He is known primarily as an elemental monk — someone whose body and spirit have harmonized with the leylines near the Valkun Rift.

**Abilities and Style**  
Arkhe manipulates elemental forces through his connection to ambient ley energy. His movements channel wind, stone, fire, and water depending on his state of mind and the battlefield’s needs. His style emphasizes balance, conservation of motion, and reflection — rarely using more force than is required. He does not wear armor and wields no weapons beyond his own limbs and momentum.

**Background**  
 Arkhe was left at the door of the Valkun temple when he was a baby. The environment of shifting elemental conditions in the temple altered his physiology, imbuing him with latent responsiveness to ley currents. Over decades of meditation, discipline, and training atop the cliffs beneath the Rift, he grew attuned to the world’s flow — gaining access to elemental magic without formal spellcasting.

Though raised among peacekeepers, Arkhe eventually left Valkun’s Reach to explore the galaxy. His journey is one of **internal searching** — seeking understanding of rift phenomena, energy balance, and the growing instability he senses across systems.

**Personality**  
Quiet, observant, and empathetic, Arkhe speaks little but listens deeply. He is known to offer strange wisdom mid-battle, and often defuses conflict through posture and presence alone. Despite this, he is not naive — when diplomacy fails, he strikes with sudden, overwhelming precision.

**Notable History**  
Arkhe once intervened alone during a minor rift outbreak in the outer Crescent and neutralized three major manifestations without assistance. While he has no official recognition from the Constellian Alliance or IWO, his name is quietly circulated in reconnaissance records as a wildcard force — a figure who appears unexpectedly in crises, resolves them, and vanishes.

### **Avarice**

**Profile**  
Avarice is a water-attuned cleric hailing from **Del'Terah**, a lush oceanic planet marked by vast fjords, sunken temples, and semi-submerged cities. She is a devout follower of the water goddess **Myriel** and serves as a traveling divine channeler — both a healer and a wielder of destructive tidal magic. Though not formally tied to any galactic faction, she has participated in several interstellar operations under alliance banners when rift activity threatens sacred waters.

**Abilities and Style**  
Avarice is a blessed conduit of Myriel’s power. Her magic takes the form of purifying bursts, hydrokinetic projectiles, defensive mist veils, and healing tides. She wields a focus staff, adorned with living coral that responds to nearby leywater. Her style blends support and aggression — capable of restoring allies as easily as she can unleash high-pressure strikes.

She’s particularly dangerous in environments with ambient moisture or proximity to water, where her magic intensifies. In arid terrain, her power is diminished but never useless — thanks to a reservoir gem she wears that stores divine energy in liquid form.

**Background**  
Avarice was raised in one of the great river temples of Del'Terah, an environment of peace, joy, and ritual. Her magical aptitude was evident from a young age, and her connection to Myriel manifested during adolescence — marked by dreams, floods of emotion, and the sudden ability to calm storm tides during monsoon season.

While many of her temple sisters remained, Avarice became restless. She found spiritual joy not in seclusion but in movement — and she took to the stars in service of the goddess, hoping to spread protection and purification where needed most. Her pilgrimage has since taken her to numerous fringe worlds and destabilized sectors, where she provides both healing and judgment.

**Personality**  
 Avarice is cheery, irreverent, and sarcastic — more likely to crack a joke mid-crisis than deliver a solemn incantation. While deeply devout, she has no interest in robes, incense, or formality. Her faith is pragmatic and lived — shown through action, not performance. She enjoys banter, dislikes bureaucracy, and always fights for the underdog, even when it's inconvenient.

**Notable History**  
Avarice helped cleanse the tainted river systems of **Karros Delta**, a once-barren moon transformed by riftblight. Her purging efforts, combined with an IWO containment team, prevented an entire hydrozone from collapsing into chaos. Despite being offered formal titles by several systems, she declined, stating she was “on an open-ended appointment from a higher office.”

### **Faru**

**Profile**  
 Faru is a Rifthunter from Thalnys, a remote and technologically underdeveloped planet far from the galactic core. While Thalnys rarely sees large-scale rift events, it suffers from constant minor riftbreaks, which have over time led to extensive mutation of native wildlife and unstable terrain. Without a centralized military, most villages and small cities rely on freelance rifthunters for protection — genetically altered warriors trained from youth to combat rift-corrupted threats.

Faru is unaffiliated with any galactic faction and operates as a freelance hunter, moving from job to job, driven more by principle than coin.

**Abilities and Style**  
Faru wields a single-handed, energy-based sword capable of being augmented with elemental infusions — most notably fire. His combat style emphasizes buff-centric momentum: he becomes significantly more dangerous as the fight progresses, layering damage boosts, healing surges, and resistance buffs.

Faru also has an innate resistance to rift corruption, the result of old genetic experiments passed down from the original rifthunter program that once operated on Thalnys.

**Background**  
 Faru was raised in one of Thalnys’ many hunter enclaves — isolated compounds that train rifthunters in both survival and anti-rift combat from a young age. His lineage traces back to an experimental military initiative designed to enhance rift resistance and tracking ability. That program collapsed centuries ago, but it's surviving operatives formed the early rifthunter schools, which now function more like mercenary clans.

Faru’s early years were marked by hardship and discipline. Orphaned young and trained in harsh biomes, he developed a keen tactical mind and a relentless fighting instinct. Though well known across Thalnys, he eventually began traveling offworld, taking contracts in underprotected systems where riftbreaks threaten isolated colonies.

**Personality**  
Stoic, focused, and solitary, Faru speaks little and acts fast. He values clarity, directness, and efficiency — and has no patience for politics or ceremony. While emotionally reserved, he does hold a deep protective instinct, particularly for innocents and untrained civilians.

He is known to walk away from lucrative contracts if they violate his personal code: protect the unarmed, finish what you start, and never endanger another hunter.

**Notable History**  
Faru was contracted to assist in clearing the lower mining basin of Cirellas I, where rift creatures had burrowed into deep infrastructure. Using only close-quarters combat and terrain manipulation, he neutralized the lead corrupted entity, a Goliath-class serpent, while avoiding a full collapse of the mine shaft. 

## Constellian Affiliated

### **Rover**

**Profile**  
Rover is a modified combat-support droid serving aboard Constellian Navy single-pilot interceptor vessels as a tactical adjunct and systems specialist. Originally built from a common astromech-class model available to civilians in Constellian systems, Rover has undergone extensive post-manufacture modification to meet the Navy’s high-performance standards — particularly those of the elite Riftstrike carrier fleet.

Unlike most non-sentient droids, Rover possesses a stable AI core with adaptive learning protocols, giving him a distinct personality and battlefield intuition. While he is not unique in chassis design, the combination of his field modifications and accumulated experience make him one of the most reliable droids in the Navy’s current roster.

**Abilities and Style**  
Rover functions as a multipurpose tactical support unit, capable of handling systems monitoring, emergency shielding, onboard diagnostics, and precision targeting adjustments. During active operations, he assists Navy strike pilots with navigation, real-time threat projection, and energy efficiency balancing.

His compact frame hides retractable arms, stabilizer limbs, and a modular arc-blaster, primarily used for disorienting or disabling riftborn that breach ship interiors. In extended engagements, he’s capable of patching command relays, rerouting internal energy flow, or initiating subsystem lockdowns if compromised.

He also carries an internal data cache of pre-mapped rift formations, collected across dozens of deployments. This makes him particularly useful in missions involving unstable space.

**Background**  
Rover was originally assigned to a Constellian Interceptor, a solo-class starcraft used for responding to medium-threat rift breaks across the outer alliance systems. His first partner was a seasoned pilot from Tarkala Prime, and over nearly a decade of service, Rover adapted to both human psychology and high-pressure combat rhythms.

Following the Interceptor’s destruction in a cross-system skirmish, Rover was recovered, repaired, and retrofitted by a technomantic engineer aboard the Launchship Perseid, who recognized the unusual pattern consistency in Rover’s behavior matrix. Rather than wiping him, the engineer reinforced his casing, expanded his command clearance, and gave him a full interface module for carrier-based systems.

Since then, Rover has served with distinction across multiple deployments, primarily as a co-pilot and systems assistant to Riftstrike crews, though he occasionally operates solo as a shipboard tech responder.

**Personality**  
Rover speaks in monotone Galactic Common, using short, clipped sentences devoid of inflection. His humor is dry, and whether or not he understands sarcasm is a matter of ongoing debate. He often makes blunt observations about survival odds, system damage, or officer decisions, and while not insubordinate, he’s not especially deferential either.

He shows a surprising degree of loyalty to the pilots he works with, often disobeying procedural safety to extract injured allies or hold position during extreme duress. While he does not express emotion conventionally, his prioritization routines often reflect a deep-set drive to protect those he considers part of “his crew.”

Rover is a machine, and therefore not great at reading human emotions. He does not process moral gray areas well and struggles with civilian-facing negotiation protocols. He is known to escalate low-threat scenarios if insufficiently briefed.

**Notable History**  
Rover was awarded a Navy Distinction Module for his role in the defense of Launchship Arisynth, where he single handedly reconnected severed data conduits under fire, restored engine thrust controls, and activated emergency shielding — all while the main systems crew was incapacitated. His intervention allowed the ship to escape a Class A riftburst in orbit over Virellion’s second moon.

He now serves as a training droid and combat partner aboard the Navy’s interceptor fleet, and multiple new recruits have requested him specifically — despite his dry mannerisms and tendency to recite ship failure statistics mid-flight.

### **Captain Dinso**

**Profile**  
Dinso is a decorated officer of the Constellian Army, best known as the commanding captain of the 73rd Constellian Company (73rd CC). The 73rd CC is a versatile deployment unit stationed for rapid planetary response. Born in Silgar and trained at StarSprawler Academy, Dinso later transferred into the Constellian forces, rising through the ranks not just through tactical success but for his unwavering reputation as a protector and battlefield leader.

**Abilities and Style**  
Dinso specializes in close-quarters combat and frontline leadership. His most iconic piece of equipment is a custom-built integrated shield-spear, a defensive armament engineered to absorb energy-based attacks and redirect them with brutal counterforce. His armor system is outfitted with advanced energy absorption, allowing him to reflect low-level energy attacks by transferring the energy into his shield and tank incoming fire to protect his squad. Dinso's combat style emphasizes defensive positioning, rally coordination, and maintaining squad integrity under pressure. He’s rarely the first to strike, but he does so in a deliberate, decisive manner.

**Background**  
 Dinso was born into a working-class family in Silgar’s west quarter and was accepted into SSA after demonstrating exceptional composure and leadership in youth drills. While not the strongest cadet in his class, he was widely respected for his judgment, courage, and unshakeable focus.

After graduating, he opted to transfer into the Constellian Army, a path chosen by few from Silgar, believing that the Alliance’s broader fight needed leaders who valued restraint as much as force. He steadily rose to the rank of captain, eventually taking command of the 73rd CC, a unit known for difficult deployments with little backup.

**Personality**  
Dinso is charismatic, principled, and deeply protective of those under his command. He leads from the front but only when necessary — preferring to empower his squad and trust their training. His demeanor is calm but commanding, and his presence is known to steady even panicking units.

He rarely speaks of himself or his past accomplishments, believing that survival and teamwork are the only meaningful victories. His virtue of loyalty is also his biggest blindspot, as he is loyal to a fault to his soldiers, even if some betray it. 

**Notable History**  
During a critical deployment to Virellion IV, the 73rd CC was caught in an unexpected rift eruption that released one apex-class and several goliath-class rift creatures. With communications disrupted and reinforcements days away, Dinso held a defensive line across a fractured ridge for over thirty hours, sustaining continuous waves of attacks.

Utilizing terrain, squad coordination, and his own shielding abilities, Dinso’s leadership enabled the survival of nearly the entire unit. When Constellian reinforcements finally arrived, they found the line intact — and Dinso still standing. The event earned the 73rd CC a formal commendation, and Dinso himself became a revered figure among command circles, though he declined a promotion, stating his place was “with the company, not behind a desk.”

### 

### 

### **Krakoa**

**Profile**  
Krakoa is a Voidblade operative in the Constellian Navy’s elite special forces division, originally born and trained in Silgar. Though a graduate of StarSprawler Academy, Krakoa’s path through the academy was anything but conventional. His combat instincts, while exceptional, were often flagged as dangerously aggressive — nearly disqualifying him from advancement. He was eventually recruited into the Voidblade program after catching the attention of a Vice Helm during a live simulation.

**Abilities and Style**  
Krakoa fights with a high-density battle axe, known as *Riftbreaker*, crafted with a frosted edge and an internal containment coil that channels cryo-kinetic energy. The axe can emit concentrated blasts of cold from its edge, freezing or slowing targets upon contact. In melee, it allows Krakoa to generate sudden bursts of force and suppressive pressure that overwhelm most opponents within seconds.

He is trained in close-range breach tactics, ambush disruption, and rapid execution, the hallmarks of a Voidblade operative. His combat style is brutally efficient, favoring total enemy neutralization over measured restraint.

**Background**  
 At the age of fifteen, Krakoa and his father were caught in an unexpected riftbreak. The rupture hurled them into the northern wastelands of Arkhalion, a desolate region still scarred by ancient rift devastation. His father was killed not long after arrival, and Krakoa spent the next several months surviving alone among hostile terrain and mutated wildlife.

He eventually escaped through a second rift that opened briefly in the area — and reappeared near civilization. Upon his return to Silgar,he was an emaciated, battle-hardened survivor. Though he was accepted into SSA, his early training was marked by uncontrolled brutality and difficulty adapting to structured discipline. He would likely have failed out if not for a demonstration during a high-stakes live combat trial, where his raw combat efficiency drew the attention of a visiting Vice Helm. Recognizing a potential asset, the Vice Helm arranged for Krakoa to be transferred into the Voidblade program, where his talents could be refined under intense supervision.

**Personality**  
Krakoa is quiet and direct, rarely indulging in unnecessary conversation. He has no strong political beliefs and seems motivated solely by action. He is a soldier more concerned with ending a threat than understanding it. In battle, he is merciless and often pushes past operational boundaries in pursuit of a swift conclusion.

Outside of combat, however, Krakoa exhibits surprising emotional restraint. He shows no unwarranted hostility toward allies and generally maintains a respectful, if distant, demeanor. His greatest flaw is impatience . He has little tolerance for bureaucracy, over-planning, or drawn-out discussions. Among his squad, this often manifests in him acting early or aggressively before orders are fully resolved.

**Notable History**  
 Krakoa played a key role in the containment of a rift eruption on Darsa-Ten, a civilian-dense asteroid colony under Virellion control. When the deployment plan failed and the standard team was overrun by Goliath-class entities, Krakoa entered the breach site alone and neutralized three of the largest riftborn in under seven minutes. His actions allowed for the safe evacuation of over 1,000 civilians and earned him top-field distinction among Voidblade command.

He remains an active Voidblade operative with a growing number of successful solo missions and is considered one of the most effective, if volatile, field assets in the program.

## IWO

### **Rei**

**Profile**  
Rei is a mid-ranking operative within the Applied Arcana Division of the Intergalactic Wizarding Organization (IWO), holding the formal clearance rank of Tier IV Arc Warden. She is based on Arkhalion, where she oversees the testing and deployment of experimental magical technologies near active or unstable rift zones. Though not originally trained as a combatant, Rei’s years in the field have sharpened her reflexes and resilience to the point where even elite Silgarian soldiers acknowledge her capability in high-risk zones.

**Abilities and Style**  
Rei is an offensive spellcaster who specializes in lightning-based magic, honed through years of field testing volatile arcane prototypes near rift zones. Her primary weapon is a lightning-infused spear designed through a collaboration between the Applied Arcana Division and technomantic engineers — a weapon that serves equally well as a magical conduit and a physical deterrent.

Her combat style is direct, fluid, and aggressive: she channels raw electrical energy into precision strikes, often using chained bolts, piercing arcs, or magnetic discharges to destabilize enemies or disable rift-spawn before they fully manifest. Her strikes are fast and methodical, favoring overwhelming momentum over drawn-out duels.

Despite her formal title as a researcher, Rei fights like a seasoned battlecaster, often using her field knowledge of rift anomalies to strike at vulnerable energy points or to destabilize corrupted constructs mid-surge.

**Background**  
 Rei entered the IWO through the Technomantic Engineering track, showing early promise in magical-device integration and predictive instability mapping. Initially assigned to theoretical research, she volunteered for field testing after discovering flaws in containment gear that could only be identified under live rift exposure. What began as a brief deployment evolved into a multi-year tenure on the front lines of magical experimentation.

Though she was never formally trained for combat, Rei’s repeated survival in hostile environments, often while managing unstable prototypes, forced her to learn under fire. Over time, she became something of a legend within her division: flashy, elite by experience, and unflinchingly reliable in the worst conditions.

**Personality**  
 Rei is sharp, driven, and unapologetically results-focused. She speaks plainly, and tends to dominate conversations when things aren't moving fast enough. Though not intentionally rude, she has little patience for what she sees as ceremonial fluff or drawn-out theoretical debate — especially from her counterparts in the IWO’s theoretical division, whom she’s openly criticized for “publishing arcane riddles and calling it work.”

She values action over conjecture, and her respect is hard to earn but easy to lose. In the field, Rei is direct and effective, often seizing command when others hesitate. While she doesn’t enjoy conflict within her own ranks, she isn’t afraid to call out poor decisions or incompetence — sometimes in public, and sometimes more bluntly than necessary.

Rei’s flaw lies in her tunnel vision — her instinct to act can sometimes make her overlook broader implications or political sensitivities. She's been reprimanded more than once for ignoring clearance protocols, overriding senior officers, or deploying unapproved prototypes mid-operation. She doesn’t regret it. To Rei, if something works, that justifies the decision.

She enjoys recognition and doesn’t pretend otherwise — she’s proud of her accomplishments and expects credit where it’s due. Still, she prefers to earn her accolades through the work itself, not by cultivating relationships or playing IWO politics.

**Notable History**  
 Rei was the lead field operator in the Quen Halo Containment Project, which successfully stabilized an expanding rift event near the urban zones of Cindralith’s eastern arcology. Her rapid deployment of improvised anchor sigils and null field synchronizers allowed emergency units to evacuate over 10,000 civilians and halted the rift's spread until a full IWO reinforcement team arrived.

Rei received a formal commendation for her efforts. Her notes from the incident are now required reading in several Rift Theory training programs within the IWO.

### **Ulmika**

**Profile**  
Ulmika is a Tier II Field Agent assigned to the Reconnaissance Subfield of the IWO Combat Division. Born in Arkhalion’s lower plains region and raised in a modest settlement rebuilt after the Breakpoint, Ulmika was recruited early into the IWO following a childhood encounter with a minor riftbreak — an event that left her with a distinctive rift-colored eye and a subtle, persistent sensitivity to rift phenomena.

She now operates as part of forward-deployed detachments, often assigned to accompany Constellian military units during Class 3–4 riftbreaks. Her role blends recon, magical analysis, and long-range elemental support.

**Abilities and Style**  
 Ulmika’s magic is specialized around long-range elemental projection — typically fire and wind — and defensive ward deployment. She is trained to scan for early instability patterns, deploy small-scale barrier magic, and delay incoming rift manifestations long enough for allied forces to reposition or respond.

Her strength lies not in raw power, but in pattern recognition and adaptability. She can spot irregularities in rift behavior others might miss, and often notices changes in energy build-up before formal sensors can detect them. This perceptiveness is believed to be connected to the residual energy tied to her rift-damaged eye.

**Background**  
Ulmika’s path to the IWO wasn’t traditional. As a child, her village was hit by a sudden low-tier riftbreak. She survived, but not unscarred — she was left with her unusual eye and occasional uncontrolled surges of minor magic. For years, she was regarded as a liability by local authorities and even her own family. It wasn’t until a wandering IWO scout detected a lingering anomaly in her arcane signature that she was invited to undergo testing.

She barely passed the field aptitude trials and was inducted as a trainee within the Combat Division. Ulmika struggled with spellcasting under pressure, and many doubted her fit for the role. But over time, she demonstrated an unusual tenacity, gradually building a reputation not for power, but for stubbornness, sharp observation, and quiet reliability.

**Personality**  
Ulmika is talkative in bursts, especially when nervous, a habit that masks her chronic self-doubt. She speaks quickly, second-guesses herself often, and assumes she has to prove her worth in every deployment. Among close allies, though, she’s quick-witted and disarmingly sincere. She is the kind of person who’s bad at hiding her feelings, even when she tries to.

She deeply wants to matter, not for recognition, but so she can justify her presence on the battlefield. This insecurity, combined with her childhood trauma, makes her overly cautious in high-stakes scenarios, but also makes her one of the few agents who consistently questions assumptions and spots overlooked details.

Though many in the IWO questioned her place in the field early on, those who’ve worked with her more than once usually request her again.

**Notable History**  
Ulmika was instrumental in uncovering the energy distortion pattern that preceded the two-pronged rift attack on the outskirts of Cindralith — an anomaly most scanners dismissed as noise. Her manual recalibration of the detection grid allowed the IWO to redirect troops and civilians just in time, preventing an ambush that could have resulted in a few dozen casualties.

Though she received no formal recognition for her efforts, she received a letter from the Combat Arc Warden who responded to the threat, in which she was offered praise for her efforts. Ulmika considers it her most prized possession.

## Arkhalion

### **Nou**

**Profile**  
Nou is a wind-aligned divine being and the central protector of Aetherion, one of the three major cities of Arkhalion’s Delta. Though once a lesser-known entity in the pre-Breakpoint era, Nou rose to prominence after the catastrophe, becoming the spiritual and magical guardian of survivors in the southern hemisphere. In the present day, she is one of the few remaining divine beings still active on Arkhalion and is considered the founder and enduring protector of Aetherion.

**Abilities and Style**  
Nou’s magic is aligned with wind, memory, and spiritual elevation. She is not a warrior deity; her power is defensive, nurturing, and guiding, manifesting in massive environmental-scale spells that shield cities, displace riftstorms, or redirect energy flows. Her presence can silence violent magic, ease leyline distortion, and calm even volatile rift anomalies within a radius of several kilometers.

Nou rarely fights directly — but when she does, her attacks manifest as sweeping gusts, cutting gales, and divine aetheric pressure capable of immobilizing lesser riftborn or scattering them across terrain. Her true power lies in endurance, battlefield control, and resilience, but her offensive power as an ancient divine protector is still significant.

**Background**  
In the age before Breakpoint, Nou was a minor wind deity, barely acknowledged in Arkhalion’s increasingly technocratic culture. Reverence for natural or elemental spirits had long waned, replaced by divine militarism or arcane academia. Nou’s role was passive and her presence mostly ceremonial, bound to scattered shrines atop cliffs and in remote monasteries.

When Breakpoint devastated the planet, most divine entities entered direct conflict to repel the chaos. Nou did not. She lacked the power, the weapons, and, in her own admission, the courage to fight in those earliest, bloodiest years. While her peers sacrificed themselves battling Sovereign-class rift threats, she survived by sheltering scattered civilian groups in isolated pockets of the southern highlands.

Her survival brought with it deep guilt. But that guilt became a call to action. Nou reoriented her purpose — not to dominate or conquer, but to preserve, protect, and elevate. She gathered survivors, taught them magic, calmed leyline storms, and formed protective sanctuaries where children could be born and cities could begin again.

These outposts would later coalesce into Aetherion, and Nou, once forgotten, became its soul.

**Personality**  
Nou is wise and composed, but not distant. She speaks softly, with warmth, and sees value in every soul she interacts with. She carries the burden of survival and remembrance heavily, and it defines how she leads with restraint, humility, and a near-fanatical devotion to avoiding unnecessary loss.

Her flaw is rooted in that same devotion. Nou is often slow to act when violence is required, sometimes waiting too long for diplomacy, protection, or reform to succeed before deploying force. While she is respected across the planet, she is not feared — a trait that has led to political friction, especially with Silgar’s military elite.

She places immense trust in those she mentors and surrounds herself with wise mortals, believing that the age of divine rulers is over — and that her role now is to guide, not command.

**Notable History**  
Nou personally protected the upper cliffs of Aetherion during the **Second Sovereign Assault** in the Divine Rift wars, holding a leyward shield against riftflare bombardment for seven days while mages below evacuated the academy’s younger students. Her efforts saved untold lives and allowed the city’s leycore to remain stable, preventing further dimensional collapse in the region. Without her protection, it is believed the outpost as a whole would have fallen, with the great mages of post breakpoint Arkhalion almost all falling with it.

Though credited as a key reason for Aetherion’s survival, Nou rarely discusses the event, instead pointing to her students and their efforts during the reconstruction.

---

### **Sedra**

**Profile**  
Sedra is a magically gifted young woman born in Aetherion, the daughter of two of the city’s most influential figures. Her father holds the Elevation Seat on the Council of Ascendance, while her mother serves as the current Windsage of the Whispering Academy. From an early age, Sedra demonstrated signs of inborn divine energy, believed by scholars to be a faint resonance of Nou’s blessing, or perhaps a unique convergence of Aetherion’s ley currents and her bloodline. She is a rising defender of Aetherion and often serves as a first response combatant for major rift activity in the region.

**Abilities and Style**  
Sedra’s magic blends energy manipulation, divine durability, and flight-based maneuverability. She wears a pair of magically reinforced bracers designed to amplify high-speed elemental bursts — turning her strikes into explosive bursts of force.

Her most distinctive trait is her ability to fly unaided, moving with fluid, acrobatic speed through the battlefield. She functions as both a high-speed attacker and magical disruptor, able to reposition quickly, strike key targets, and intercept ranged threats. Though her raw destructive capacity is still maturing, her battlefield mobility makes her extremely difficult to pin down.

**Background**  
Sedra was raised in the elevated tiers of Aetherion, surrounded by arcane scholars, spiritual leaders, and magical theory. Her childhood was comfortable but never passive — she was pushed by both parents to master the expectations of their stations, and she rarely had time to truly relax. Early on, the Whispering Academy identified her latent divine resonance, and she became the subject of both training and study, with experts rotating through her life to refine her abilities.

Despite being trained in magical theory, her affinity skewed physical — a point of mild controversy among Aetherion’s more traditionalist scholars. Rather than mastering elaborate spellcraft, Sedra excelled at high-speed magic-channeling and practical application. Over time, she grew into her own niche, a magical combatant in a city that preferred mages at a distance.

**Personality**  
Sedra is confident, expressive, and idealistic, but not naïve. She believes Aetherion is a model for how people should live — not just with magic, but with one another. That belief drives her commitment to defend it, even when the fight takes her beyond city walls.

She struggles, however, with pressure. Being the child of two major figures has led to a deep fear of public failure, and her charisma masks an internal fear of disappointing the legacy she represents. While she has faith in her strength, she sometimes overcompensates — acting too quickly or taking unnecessary risks just to prove she can handle things without her family’s name.

Still, Sedra is fiercely loyal, especially to the younger mages she mentors at the academy. She believes in the power of community and holds great respect for Nou, though she sometimes questions the goddess’s reluctance to confront threats more directly.

**Notable History**  
At age 17, during her final year at the Whispering Academy, a Class B riftbreak erupted near the mountain span of Cloudbreak Ridge, threatening a sky-settlement of over 400 people. Aetherion’s guard was days away, and the Council debated delaying intervention for safety. 

Sedra, then still a student, took flight alone—without permission, without equipment, only her bracers and what control she had over her durability spells.

Eyewitnesses recall her cutting through the air like a falling star, shielding villagers from collapsing debris and fighting off a Mizca-class beast midair. Her actions bought enough time for a full response team to arrive and stabilize the rift. From that day forward, she was no longer just the daughter of two high mages. She became Sedra of the Windfall, the first Aetherion-born hero of her generation.

### **Huron**

**Profile**  
Huron is one of the most powerful mortals in Arkhalion’s history, a warrior of near-divine might and the living embodiment of Silgar’s martial spirit. He was Arkhalion, delivered to the IWO as an infant by a divine beast during the height of the post-Breakpoint chaos. His origin remains shrouded in mystery, but his life since has been an open record of war, growth, and sacrifice.

Trained by Gosen, Silgar’s founder and last living divine general, Huron was raised in a world clawing its way back from oblivion. Though not a leader in the traditional sense, he became a symbol of resilience and the most celebrated independent combatant of the Delta — and perhaps the entire Constellian Alliance.

**Abilities and Style**  
Huron’s powers center on raw energy projection, flight, and enhanced durability, making him a living engine of force. He fights using unarmed martial techniques amplified by stored divine energy — though in recent centuries, he has trained with various forms of combat, learning from alien systems and rift-born encounters.

He is able to fly at extreme speeds, deflect rift energy blasts, and generate concentrated bursts of energy that can level battlefield-scale threats. During critical events, he has worn specially engineered bracers and armor designed by the IWO to amplify residual divine energy, enabling temporary combat surges rivaling sovereign-tier entities.

Huron’s fighting style reflects his training: precise, adaptive, and direct. He favors fair fights but has learned through bitter experience when to discard restraint.

**Background**  
Huron was brought to the IWO in **58 AB**,by a divine beast that may have been his parent. The beast was an active participant in the divine rift wars, and sought the IWO’s help in raising the boy. As he grew up, It became clear he could not be raised in the IWO’s growing bureaucratic base, he was too strong, too wild, and too vital. In **67 AB**, Gosen personally took Huron into his satellite fortress, raising him as a ward and student.

Under Gosen’s tutelage, Huron learned restraint, combat discipline, and an unshakable sense of morality. Unlike his mentor, Huron valued mercy over dominance and fairness over victory — a temperament that would both elevate and complicate his role in Silgar’s future.

He began formal combat deployment around **200 AB**, quickly developing into one of Silgar’s most potent warriors. His early career was rocky — raw strength unmatched by tactical discipline — but over time, he grew into a devastating battlefield presence, particularly against rift entities.

In **592 AB**, Huron faced the Sovereign-class riftspawn **Renethal** in deep space. The battle nearly killed him, and he remained comatose for three decades before returning in **622 AB**. In **887 AB**, he led the defense during Renethal’s second assault, this time wearing specially engineered Constellian battlegear and fighting alongside Nou and elite mortal allies. Together, they forced Renethal into retreat, one of the few times such a creature has voluntarily withdrawn.

**Personality**  
Huron is charismatic, free-spirited, and deeply moral. He prefers wandering over ruling and mentorship over command. Though he often speaks casually and disarms with humor, he has a keen emotional intelligence and a near-perfect memory for those he’s met in the field.

Despite his high battle IQ, Huron is not very adept when it comes to information needed for day to day life. He is a wild spirit who loves the thrill of a fight, and cannot settle down. While his presence inspires entire armies, he often disappears for decades at a time, returning only when the fight demands it.

He believes that his power is a gift to be used in defense of life, but not in the service of empire or politics.

**Notable History**  
Beyond his battles with Renethal, Huron has fought in hundreds of major events across the Delta and beyond. During the **Collapse at the Orbital Maw**, he alone handled several apex class threats.. His fight left the surrounding space cratered and inert — a rare example of a mortal sealing a cosmic-scale tear without divine assistance.

In the present day, Huron’s location is unknown. Most believe he still resides on Arkhalion, enjoying his free time, waiting for the next true threat to rise.

### **Olthar**

**Profile**  
Olthar is the Lawbearer of Silgar and the highest judicial authority in the city-state. A sentient construct forged by the Intergalactic Wizarding Organization (IWO) during the darkest days of Silgar’s history, Olthar represents the fusion of divine essence, technomantic engineering, and legal idealism. Though not a divine being in strength, he possesses a soul, one of the first successful artificial souls ever manifested, and a mind built for clarity, logic, and incorruptibility.

He is widely credited with ending Silgar’s most shameful period (The Shrouded Silgar era) and establishing the modern legal and ethical framework under which the city now operates.

**Abilities and Style**  
Olthar’s body is a heavily reinforced technomantic shell composed of a rare alloy, arcane lattice frameworks, and a unique core that houses his soul — a product of an IWO experiment involving fractured divine essence. While not a frontline combatant, he is exceptionally durable, equipped with internal shielding systems and energy disruption protocols designed to restrain or disable violent threats.

His true strength lies in his mental architecture: Olthar processes logic, evidence, and contradiction with unparalleled precision. His presence exerts a low-level magical field of order, subtly suppressing chaotic magic and emotional instability within his vicinity — an ability particularly useful in trials and high-tension proceedings.

**Background**  
Olthar was created in 269 AB, during the height of the Shrouded Silgar Era — a time when military elites, empowered by their proximity to the Grand Marshal, had overridden judicial oversight. Corruption ran deep, commanders were appointed by favor rather than merit, and the Silgarian people suffered in silence.

To combat this without igniting political instability, the IWO developed a secret project: a construct capable of holding a soul, one which could observe, assess, and eventually act without the trappings of bias or ambition. Using the fractured remnant of a divine spirit and a purpose-built mechanical body, Olthar was born and placed under the indirect protection of Huron, who at the time was too young to intervene politically but too important to be crossed openly.

For decades, Olthar learned silently, gathering evidence, analyzing the law, and slowly understanding the nuances of justice not just as code, but as lived experience. In 298 AB, following a public incident involving the silencing of protestors and state-sanctioned arrests at a commemorative festival, Olthar made his move.

Together with Huron and a growing network of disillusioned citizens, he exposed the full extent of military corruption, leading public trials that reverberated across Arkhalion. These trials were defined by their transparency, procedural rigor, and refusal to shield even the highest-ranking officials. Olthar’s conduct during this time solidified his role as the moral compass of Silgar.

**Personality**  
 Olthar speaks in a deep, grinding voice — slow, deliberate, but with weight. He is not emotionless, but he is rarely expressive. His empathy is intellectual rather than sentimental: he cares because he has chosen to, not because it comes instinctively.

He is profoundly committed to fairness, believing that laws must be applied equally to have meaning. His flaw, however, lies in his rigidity. In his pursuit of structure and justice, Olthar can sometimes dismiss context or the emotional weight of mercy. While he is capable of compassion, it takes him longer to arrive at it, and he often requires others like Huron to remind him that order is only valuable if it serves the people.

Olthar is respected, even feared, but not universally beloved. His very presence is a symbol of scrutiny, and he prefers it that way.

**Notable History**  
Olthar’s defining moment was the Fall of the Shrouded Silgar Regime, during which he presided over the trial of the Grand Marshal’s inner circle. His refusal to accept plea deals, bribes, or compromise, even under direct threat, reshaped Silgar’s governance permanently. Following the trial, he was granted full judicial authority and founded what would become the Silguard, Silgar’s independent legal enforcement body.

He has held the role of Lawbearer ever since, and no ruling he has made has ever been overturned.

### **VyGar**

**Profile**

VyGar is a Stonebound construct, a semi-living being formed of ancient rock and infused with rift-stabilized ley energy. Forged in the Foundations beneath Silgar, he was originally assigned as the guardian of the Ley Core beneath Triarc Keep, a vital stabilizing structure that anchors leyline activity in the southern hemisphere of Arkhalion. When deep rift breaches threatened the surface, VyGar voluntarily left his post to join the effort aboveground — emerging not just as a protector of ley energy, but as a frontline ally against riftborn threats.

Though he speaks and acts with wisdom beyond most mortals, VyGar is not divine. He is the product of ancient craftsmanship, arcane experimentation, and a soul bound through early IWO technomantic methods — a younger cousin, in spiritual terms, to constructs like Olthar.

**Abilities and Style**  
VyGar’s power centers around defense, resilience, and elemental force. He wields a massive stone-forged spear and uses it to channel seismic energy, repel attackers, and anchor leyline instability. His most common battlefield applications include protective shielding, area disruption, and resistance amplification — making him a powerful support figure in prolonged engagements.

His body serves as a partial ley conductor. When positioned near major ley flows or planetary cores, his strength and magical endurance increase significantly. His signature techniques include projecting elemental shockwaves, forming kinetic barriers, and summoning meteor-like strikes against multiple enemies.

VyGar’s combat approach is deliberate and unyielding: he does not move fast, but he does not break.

**Background**  
VyGar was forged during a wave of IWO-led experimentation shortly after the creation of Olthar, with the goal of binding stabilized rift fragments to ley-reactive material. Though his essence is less potent than that of divine-fueled constructs, VyGar’s core is more attuned to planetary energy, allowing him to interact directly with ley structures without distorting them.

For decades, he stood sentinel over the Ley Core beneath Triarc Keep, monitoring fluctuations and guarding against underground corruption. But when multiple deep breaches threatened to collapse the ley matrix during a string of Class A rift events, VyGar emerged from the deep tunnels and took to the surface, joining Silgar’s broader military structure as a battlefield support asset.

Though technically not enlisted, he is treated with the rank of a specialist and is deployed when ley instability or large-scale energy shielding is required.

**Personality**  
VyGar is measured, methodical, and quietly philosophical. He speaks slowly, his voice echoing like grinding stone, and is known for his long pauses between thoughts. Unlike Olthar, VyGar was not designed to arbitrate law or logic, his soul, though artificial, is attuned to harmony rather than structure.

He is deeply empathetic in his own way, especially toward lifeforms he considers fragile. He views most mortals with gentle reverence and often comments on the shortness of human memory or the patterns of history he’s observed.

VyGar rarely adapts, which can lead to missed opportunities or overcommitment in battle. He also carries a quiet sadness from years of isolation in the deep, making him slow to trust and occasionally distant in moments that require closeness.

**Notable History**  
VyGar played a central role in the defense of the Triarc Confluence, a leyline convergence point that risked full collapse during a high-tier rift flare. While others fought to contain the riftspawn, VyGar remained rooted at the leyline’s epicenter for nine hours, redirecting energy, absorbing destabilizing pulses, and forming layered shields that prevented a full planetary quake.

To this day, no other construct has ever interfaced with an active ley core for that duration and survived intact.

### **Jack**

**Profile**  
Jack is a rogue artificer and saboteur hailing from Cindralith, known for his deep understanding of arcano-technological systems and a long history of weaponized mischief. Once a promising student at one of Cindralith’s top-tier engineering universities, Jack dropped out, or was expelled, depending on which version of the story he’s telling, and disappeared into the undercity.

He has since reemerged as a solo operative, deploying experimental gadgets and improvised tech to disable military-grade systems, disorient enemies, and undermine larger power structures. While not formally aligned with any state or institution, Jack often appears in Constellian Army databases , as a person of interest linked to unsanctioned weapons theft, sabotage, or data extraction.

**Abilities and Style**  
Jack is not a traditional frontline combatant. He specializes in gadget-driven disruption, often entering fights already aware of how to dismantle his opponents’ tech. His primary weapon is a modular wrist device capable of emitting EMP bursts, deploying hard-light projections, or rewiring basic automated systems on the fly.

In combat, Jack focuses on misdirection, overloading enemy hardware, and exploiting vulnerabilities in energy fields or shielding. He frequently carries disguised tools — including magnetic grenades disguised as coins, invisible tripwires, and auto-deploying drones — and is known for setting ambushes mid-conversation.

His real edge, however, comes from his mental playbook: Jack remembers everything. He tracks enemy formations, system IDs, firewall patterns, and tells in body language — all while cracking a joke or spinning a tale.

**Background**  
Jack grew up in the mid-tier residential arc of Cindralith — not quite poor, but not close to elite. His early brilliance was undeniable: he was building interference jammers by age 10 and breaking campus-wide network firewalls by 14\. Recognized by the prestigious Cynosure Institute, he entered their fast-track innovation program, but quickly found the institution’s rigid structure suffocating, and the cost of living in the inner city untenable.

Late into his second year in college, whether due to costs or the system, he dropped out. Years later, surveillance drones picked him up breaking into a research center he once helped design, disabling it with a device made out of scrap and walking out with prototype schematics.

Since then, Jack has become a ghost in the system: appearing in sabotage operations, staging counter-hacks during rift events, and assisting resistance groups — often for reasons known only to him.

Personality  
 Jack is talkative, smug, and dangerously charming. He narrates his own actions aloud, riffs during tense moments, and never lets silence last more than a few seconds. He thrives in tension, often escalating a situation just to watch how people react.

He’s deeply clever, but also deeply self-interested. He doesn’t sabotage for the thrill — he does it to prove he’s smarter than everyone else in the room. He rarely forms lasting attachments, preferring temporary alliances built on leverage or mutual inconvenience.

Jack believes he can outthink, outbuild, or outmaneuver anyone — and while this is often true, it’s also gotten him into near-death situations more times than he’ll admit. He also has a habit of underestimating long-term consequences, preferring clever solutions over safe ones.

Notable History  
Jack became infamous after an event that would come to be called “The Circuit Eclipse”. During a high-profile demo attended by Cindralith’s financial elite, every drone in the exhibit malfunctioned simultaneously. The drones spoke the words “You call this progress? You name theft discovery? If I am a failure, then why do your machines speak in my voice?”. Moments later, the entire expo’s lighting system dimmed into an eclipse-like gradient as one of the structural spires emitted Jack’s symbol (a fractal loop broken in the center). The effect lasted only 43 seconds—but by then, cameras and social media had done the rest.

Cynosure called the stunt “panic-manufacturing theater” and increased their safety protocols. Meanwhile, Jack became a bit of a cult hero for disenfranchised students and inventors.

### **KAS**

**Profile**  
KAS (Kinematic Assault System) is a hyper-agile mechanized combat unit developed by a private military tech group in Cindralith under the banner of Halion Dynamics. Designed to serve as a single-unit strike operative, KAS combines state-of-the-art technomantic circuitry with physical design principles derived from Rift-class creature countermeasures. The result is a machine optimized for high-speed, close-quarters combat — one that moves with frightening precision, reacts faster than the human eye, and follows its combat directives with unrelenting efficiency.

Though KAS units were initially envisioned as mass-producible models, only a handful were completed before the program was quietly shuttered. 

**Abilities and Style**  
KAS is built for melee dominance. One of its arms functions as a retractable mono-edged energy blade, powered by a microcore reactor and enhanced by magnetic edge stabilization. This allows KAS to parry large projectiles, cleave through armored targets, and deflect unstable rift matter.

Its combat software allows it to anticipate and adapt to enemy patterns in real-time, and it is known to perform counterattacks while in motion , a trait that gives it an almost organic feel despite its mechanical precision.

While it lacks ranged weapons by default, KAS compensates through dash-assist systems, cloaking modules, and short-term energy acceleration bursts, allowing it to close gaps and dismantle enemies before they can respond.

**Background**  
KAS was constructed by Halion Dynamics, one of Cindralith’s oldest independent research centers. Founded during the rise of Cindralith’s financial elite, Halion pursued AI-combat research with little oversight. The KAS initiative was originally pitched as a scalable anti-rift defense platform — cheap enough to manufacture widely, strong enough to contest mid-tier threats.

But as the test models progressed, it became clear that full-tier KAS units were too expensive, too specialized, and too independently minded to serve as mass combat drones. The program was shut down after a classified incident during a live-fire test involving a Mizca.

This particular KAS was salvaged by Constellian Navy operatives, and after extensive reprogramming and reinforcement, it was placed into active combat testing as part of experimental deployments. Its unique performance has kept it in service long after the original blueprints were mothballed.

**Personality**  
 KAS does not possess a “personality” in the traditional sense, but it demonstrates pattern-linked preferences, vocal variance, and limited self-referential language. It often speaks in clipped, command-like phrases and will occasionally narrate its own kill calculations — a remnant of early Halion programming intended to instill terror in enemies.

KAS prioritizes mission outcomes over allied survival, though its behavior has evolved slightly over time, especially during repeated deployments alongside Constellian ground forces. It has been observed shielding fallen allies or responding to indirect commands with logic deviations, suggesting emergent decision heuristics.

It’s known for its predictable ruthlessness. KAS will almost always choose the mathematically optimal route, even if that route causes diplomatic or moral complications. It does not bargain, hesitate, or bluff.

**Notable History**  
 During the Battle of Riftclaw Spires, KAS was deployed solo to delay a Goliath-class riftborn that had broken through mountain defenses. Instead of engaging directly, it collapsed three support structures, bottlenecked the target, and neutralized it using terrain-based strategy — all without higher command input.

The feat earned it recognition from Constellian command and led to renewed investment in “smart-machine-adjacent” tactical development.

## RiftBeasts

### **Raish**

**Profile**  
**Class:** Mainline  
**Range:** 4  
**Designation:** Raish  
Raish are corrupted quadrupedal riftbeasts commonly encountered in Class C or D riftbreaks across Arkhalion and nearby systems. They are mutated derivatives of a natural predator species known as the Rais, once native to Arkhalion’s southern forests and highlands. While Rais were roughly the size and strength of a large mastiff, rift corruption amplifies their aggression, durability, and instinctive cunning, making the Raish a dangerous threat in groups.

Though not individually catastrophic, their pack-based behavior and enhanced physiology make them a recurring nuisance to both frontier settlements and mid-tier military patrols.

**Behavior and Combat Traits**  
Raish move with extreme agility and exhibit semi-coordinated tactics in packs of 3 to 8\. While not sapient, they are intelligent enough to exploit line-of-sight breaks, feint charges, and distract targets for flank kills. Rift mutation often enhances their musculature, giving them bone-piercing bite force and enough speed to outpace light ground vehicles in bursts.

Their claws can shear through light armor, and their howls — augmented by rift energy — can cause momentary disorientation in unshielded opponents. In rare cases, the corruption manifests in bioluminescent tumors along their spine that pulse when alerted, possibly serving as primitive communication or a method of hunting coordination.

Raish will not retreat unless overwhelmed or outnumbered by three to one or more — and even then, some will remain behind to protect dens or territory.

**Notable Encounters**  
One of the most widely circulated reports involves the Ashenford Timberline Incident, where a patrol of only six militia scouts encountered a den of 14 Raish near the ruins of an old ley tap station. The Raish used barricade holes and the collapsed infrastructure to pick off the scouts one by one, with only a single survivor escaping due to an unstable ground collapse that took several of the beasts with it.

Since then, several Constellian squads stationed near southern Arkhalion territories are trained specifically in anti-pack maneuvering, a direct response to increased Raish proliferation during minor breaks.

### **Mizca**

**Profile**  
**Class:** Goliath  
**Range:** 2  
**Designation:** Mizca  
Mizca are high-tier riftborn entities most commonly associated with Class B riftbreaks, though many A-class incidents have reported them as forward units. Standing taller than a giraffe at full extension but built with a broad, humanoid physique, Mizca embody both raw power and battlefield disruption.

Each arm is asymmetrical: one ends in a massive hand capable of lifting and hurling boulders, while the other terminates in a permanent axe-like projection of rift-forged energy that pulses with unstable magical frequency. Despite their brutish profile, Mizca display alarming spatial awareness and can track fast-moving targets with unsettling accuracy.

**Behavior and Combat Traits**  
Mizca are true riftborn, not corrupted fauna — their existence appears wholly unnatural, spawned from the chaotic energies of Breakpoint itself. They bear no resemblance to any preexisting lifeform, and no fossil or evolutionary structure supports their form. Their anatomy is driven by function: domination, disruption, and attrition.

What sets them apart is their reactive biology. As a Mizca takes damage, its body feeds off the conflict, using the destabilized rift energy in its system to temporarily enhance its strength, aggression, and resilience. Each sustained minute of battle makes it more dangerous, with stronger impacts, faster reflexes, sharper rift-axe flares. However, this escalation comes at a cost: the unstable energy builds pressure internally, causing parts of its body to rupture or degrade over time.

If a battle drags on too long without resolution, a Mizca will begin to collapse from within, either retreating violently or unleashing a final, desperate assault before its own systems implode.

Their movement is deliberate but not slow — they tend to control space, anchoring themselves with massive legs and carving out territorial dominance through sheer kinetic threat. When cornered, they enter a berserker-like state, unleashing a frenzy that few squads survive.

**Notable Encounters**  
The Keldrath Basin Lockdown was one of the most infamous Mizca-related events. During a Goliath-class rift event, a Mizca emerged near a frontline supply station, collapsing multiple anti-rift barricades and destroying three Constellian mobile artillery units in under two minutes. The unit’s boulder toss dislodged a fortified perch 30 meters high, bringing down six defenders in one strike.

It took a combined assault of Riftguard operatives, targeted shielding disruptions, and a precision ley-pulse weapon to finally immobilize the creature.

### **Corrupted T.Rex**

**Profile**  
**Class:** Apex  
**Range:** 4  
**Designation:** Corrupted Tyrannus (commonly: “Corrupted T-Rex”)  
A towering, rift-altered predator, the Corrupted T-Rex is an apex-class threat born from the dimensional corruption of a prehistoric Earth-like species. Unlike most riftspawn, it is not an original creation of Breakpoint but a rift-mutated natural organism, elevated far beyond its original capabilities by exposure to high-intensity riftfields.

Reports place its height at nearly 20 meters with enhanced bone density, triple-reinforced musculature, and rift-reactive scales that shed kinetic energy over time. Despite its brutish form, it is one of the most persistent planetary-scale threats recorded outside of Apex-Class 2 entities.

**Behavior and Combat Traits**  
The Corrupted T-Rex thrives in sustained engagements, acting less like a hunting predator and more like a living siege engine. Its bite force, already unmatched in its original biology, is now capable of crushing Constellian armored transports, and its thick, semi-crystalline hide renders most small-arms fire functionally irrelevant.

What makes it truly Apex-class is not the speed of destruction, but its near-unstoppable attrition. A single specimen can destabilize entire ecosystems, gradually destroy infrastructure across a continent, and survive for months under constant siege. It shows no signs of fatigue, and recovery data suggest some corrupted T-Rexes have even adapted limited regenerative traits, allowing them to recover between major assaults.

Despite its size, it displays limited tactical awareness, often focusing on high-energy sources or infrastructure — suggesting a kind of imprinting behavior based on power signatures or defensive density.

Multiple coordinated strikes, including orbital bombardment or sustained artillery barrages, are typically required to bring one down. Constellian ground forces consider them a “red-grade target”, requiring direct Navy involvement if one appears near a settled zone.

**Notable Encounters**  
The Northern Virellion Quarantine began after a single Corrupted T-Rex emerged from a Class A rift near a refinery district. Over 6 weeks, it destroyed five outposts, destabilized two energy grids, and was eventually lured into a canyon, where it was brought down using ship-mounted plasma artillery and a Riftguard strike team.

Despite having taken direct hits from railcannons, it continued fighting until massive internal hemorrhaging overwhelmed its regenerative limits.

### **Renethal**

**Profile**  
**Class:** Sovereign  
**Range:** 2  
**Designation:** Renethal, the Rift-Wrought General  
Renethal is a feared **Sovereign-class entity** recorded by the IWO. A horned, devil-like quadruped with partial bipedal posture and a frame that radiates distortion, Renethal is believed to be a general of **Veyl** — the chaos force awakened during the Breakpoint.

Renethal did not appear during the Divine Rift Wars but surfaced centuries later, in 591 AB, making him the first Sovereign-class riftborn encountered since the Great Finality. His emergence marked a second galactic reckoning — not due to raw destruction, but the precision with which he coordinated multi-site riftbreaks. No other known riftspawn displays the same combination of intellect, power, and command authority.

---

**Behavior and Combat Traits**  
Renethal is a tactical Sovereign, favoring coordinated assaults, misdirection, and disruption over frontal devastation. He prefers to deploy strike teams of Apex- and Goliath-class riftspawn, often launching multiple riftbreaks at once in unpredictable sectors to overextend defenses and fracture response coordination.

When forced into direct battle, Renethal exhibits full Sovereign-class capabilities:

* Dimensional anchoring, making him incredibly difficult to displace or banish

* Reality disruption fields, causing ranged weaponry to misfire or phase

* Adaptive regeneration, with signs of rift-fueled cellular rewriting

* Massive raw strength, on par with or exceeding that of early divine beings

Renethal rarely speaks, but when he does, the sound is described as “a voice projected across dimensions”, and his few known utterances have been recorded and studied by the IWO with great concern.

---

**Notable Encounters**

**First Encounter: 591 \- 592 AB**  
Renethal appeared near the outer ring of Arkhalion space and quickly dismantled three forward listening stations, prompting emergency deployment of elite forces. The Constellian Navy and IWO failed to suppress him, but a reinforced Huron, clad in a high-output divine energy suit developed by the IWO, managed to engage Renethal in deep space.

Despite the enhancements, Huron was soundly defeated. Only the use of ancient and forbidden IWO rift-suppression magic allowed Renethal to be cast away — not destroyed, but displaced. His final words before vanishing, “*You may have sealed me away for your lifetimes, but to me, you have only delayed a few seconds*,” are etched into IWO archives and quoted with dread by Rift scholars.

**Second Encounter: 882 \- 887 AB**  
Centuries later, Renethal returned, this time leading a wave of multi-sector riftbreaks that threatened key points of the Constellian Alliance. The confrontation culminated in a climactic battle where Huron, aided by Nou, elite Riftguard operatives, and enhanced mortal support, managed to drive Renethal into retreat. Even so, it is believed that he was not fully defeated, merely wounded and forced to withdraw.

No other Sovereign-class being has yet returned — but the IWO believes Renethal is likely healed and observing from afar.
