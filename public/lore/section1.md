## Pre BreakPoint

Before the Breakpoint, Arkhalion stood as one of the most advanced and influential planets in the known galaxy. Rich in divine energy and leylines, it served as a cultural and technological hub, hosting sprawling megacities, cross-galactic trade routes, and research institutions dedicated to exploring the fabric of reality.

The planet’s divine beings — powerful entities attuned to divine energy and aligned with natural and metaphysical forces — lived alongside mortals. Many of these beings were lesser-known and rarely worshipped, as the dominant worldview of the time leaned toward technocracy and scientific progression, not religious reverence.

At the interstellar level, Arkhalion was a midpoint world — geographically and politically — sitting at the crossroads of various galactic trade routes and diplomatic channels. Its enhanced beings and ley-rich biosphere gave it a head start in long-range exploration and cosmic infrastructure. While many other civilizations had achieved space travel, Arkhalion’s unique combination of magic, divine presence, and cutting-edge science allowed it to position itself as the convergence point for innovation and influence, becoming the de facto center of the galaxy.

However, this golden age of expansion and discovery was not without hubris. In its pursuit of instant interstellar travel, a powerful coalition of mages and scientists launched an experiment designed to fold space-time and bypass galactic distance entirely — a project that would lead directly to the cataclysmic event known as the Breakpoint.

## BreakPoint Event

The Breakpoint was a cataclysmic, reality-shattering event that altered the course of galactic history. It began as a highly classified experiment on Arkhalion — an attempt by the planet’s most powerful mages and scientists to manipulate space-time and create a direct transit wormhole across the galaxy. Their goal was noble: instant travel, communication, and unity. The result was devastation.

Instead of opening a stable portal, the experiment tore a wound into the very structure of reality. Through this rupture, an ancient cosmic force — later identified as **Veyl** — stirred and partially awakened. Scholars now believe Veyl is not a god in the traditional sense, but a primordial entity tied to the chaotic energy of the multiverse. It was not summoned deliberately, but rather brushed against, roused from its slumber by the unnatural compression of space and time.

Realizing too late what they had done, the experiment’s creators attempted to restrain the breach and suppress the entity’s entry into the material plane. In doing so, they wounded Veyl and entangled its essence in the unstable rift — creating a paradox: Veyl was neither fully in the universe, nor fully sealed away.

This failure became known as the **Breakpoint** — the moment when reality lost its certainty. The skies above Arkhalion fractured. Dimensional tears erupted across the planet. Cities crumbled, divine beings fell, and from the rift surged creatures twisted by chaos, now known as riftborn. The north of Arkhalion, where the experiment took place, was annihilated by the riftborn hordes. The south too was overwhelmed, but over a century of war on the planet spearheaded by the divine beings of Arkhalion and the mages of the Intergalactic Wizarding Organization (IWO) lead to a pocket of the south enduring, in which Arkhalions 3 great cities were born.

The effects of the Breakpoint rippled outward from Arkhalion, with intensity proportional to distance from the origin. Nearby star systems — especially those lacking their own divine protectors or advanced defenses — were devastated. Entire civilizations were lost overnight to sovereign-class[^1] rift events. Worlds that had once relied on Arkhalion for protection or trade were left defenseless and vulnerable to reality collapse. Further from the epicenter, the disruptions became less frequent and more fragmented: unstable warp anomalies, minor rift tears, and temporal inconsistencies. Some distant regions of the galaxy remained almost untouched, while others suffered cascading effects years or decades later. The once-connected interstellar web of civilizations fractured into isolated zones — some lost, some fighting for survival, and a rare few already adapting to the new reality.

Arkhalion, wounded but not destroyed, became both the origin of the rift phenomenon and the first force to begin resisting it.

## Energy Systems

There are three primary forms of magical energy in the BreakPoint universe: Rift Energy, Divine Energy, and Ley Energy. These are not sources of sentient will or moral alignment, but rather natural forces that exist across space, planets, and celestial phenomena. Each energy type behaves differently, and their interactions shape much of the technological, magical, and political infrastructure in the modern galaxy.

While each can be harnessed in various ways, their behaviors and risks differ significantly. Energy types are not exclusive to any specific faction or character alignment — Rift Energy can be used for constructive purposes, and Divine Energy can be used by those with destructive intent.

The three types are as follows:

### **Rift Energy**

Rift Energy is the product of spatial and dimensional instability. It is most commonly found near rift tears—unstable anomalies where the boundaries between realities weaken or collapse. This energy is chaotic in nature, prone to causing mutation, disorientation, and distortion when left unchecked. Rift Energy does not carry intent or malice, but its volatility makes it inherently dangerous. It is capable of altering biological structures, interfering with technology, and creating spatial inconsistencies. In controlled applications, Rift Energy has been used to develop warping devices, mutation-based enhancements, and adaptive shielding. However, due to its unstable behavior, most advanced civilizations treat it as a high-risk energy type and restrict its use in populated areas.

### **Divine Energy**

Divine Energy represents structured metaphysical order. It is commonly associated with gods, sacred sites, and high-resonance artifacts, but it is not limited to religious use. Divine Energy has a stabilizing effect on physical and magical systems. It is used in soul-binding, protective wards, memory anchoring, and long-term enchantments. Its frequency is consistent and repeatable, making it ideal for advanced spellwork or constructs requiring long-duration effects. Although Divine Energy is often associated with benevolent figures or orders, it is not inherently moral or lawful—its alignment with structure and purpose can be used in service of any ideology.

### **Ley Energy**

Ley Energy is the latent potential energy found throughout the universe. It is present in both planetary and interstellar environments, though it is strongest near ley cores—natural concentrations of leylines within planetary crusts or large celestial bodies. Ley Energy is adaptive and reactive, drawing upon the user's intent and emotional state more than the other two types. It is frequently used in elemental magic, passive enhancements, environmental manipulation, and general-purpose spellcasting. Due to its accessibility and versatility, Ley Energy is the most commonly taught and studied form of energy in civilian and academic settings. In modern contexts, it also serves as the baseline power source for many hybrid magi-technological devices.

### **Energy Interactions**

While Rift, Divine, and Ley Energy can be used independently, their interactions often produce distinct effects. As the Energies act as fields, it can interact with the other forms, and even with itself. Some combinations are highly unstable, while others produce controlled or amplified outcomes. The following table summarizes these interactions in terms of their behavior when the energies are combined, either through direct application or environmental overlap.

This table is used in academic and military contexts to model risk and effect type when blending or encountering multiple energy fields.


| Interaction | Result Type | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Rift + Rift | Chaotic Cascade | Unstable reaction. Causes spatial collapse, mutation, or uncontrolled surge. |
| Rift + Divine | Paradox Clash | Conflict between chaos and structure. Results are unpredictable and volatile. |
| Rift + Ley | Unstable Amplification | Boosted power with poor control. Can enhance spells but with side effects. |
| Divine + Divine | Resonant Stability	 | Highly stable. Used in containment, ritual wards, and structure reinforcement. |
| Divine + Ley | Anchored Channeling | Balanced and controllable. Good for long-form magic or artifact creation. |
| Ley + Ley | Harmonic Flow | Natural synergy. Most commonly used for civilian, educational, and magical utility. |


## Galactic Map

**Major Galactic Zone Map**

The current model of the Galactic Map, shown below shows a rough estimation of various alliances and the systems they inhabit.  It is a first draft that shows the scale of alliances and their positions in their galaxy, but it is not concrete yet and is subject to major revisions in future iterations.
