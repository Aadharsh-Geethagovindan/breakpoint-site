## Pre BreakPoint

Before the cataclysmic event now known as the Breakpoint, Arkhalion Prime stood as the sole developed world in its system as a flourishing planet steeped in history, culture, and arcane potential. Rich in divine and leyline energy, Arkhalion Prime had long been home to powerful spiritual and magical traditions. At its peak, it was a nexus of mysticism, a world where gods had once walked among mortals and the arcane arts held sway over life and death. But by the final century before the Breakpoint, the tide had turned.

With the advent of practical spaceflight and steady progress in interstellar propulsion, Arkhalion Prime entered the Age of Reach — a technological golden era. Interstellar ships, powered by physics and engineering rather than enchantment, could now travel to neighboring star systems in weeks and more distant systems in months. Though these journeys remained arduous and imperfect, they marked the beginning of Arkhalion’s galactic ascent.

But this scientific triumph came with cultural cost. Magic was seen as slow. Spirituality, outdated. Worship and ritual faded. Divine beings, once fed by belief, waned in influence. And perhaps most critically, the Interplanetary Wizarding Organization (IWO), once unrivaled masters of arcane order, found itself in decline.

In the shadows of progress, the IWO plotted a return to power. No longer willing to play second to tech oligarchs and planetary governments, they initiated a project in secret: an effort to fold space itself. Their vision was ambitious: using arcane resonance, spatial compression, and ritual-engineering, they sought to create dimensional corridors — pathways through folded space-time that would reduce months of travel to mere hours. If successful, the IWO would become the sole arbiters of expansion. Every ship, every colony, every jump would depend on their corridors. They would not simply reclaim relevance — they would dictate the future.The project was unauthorized. Hidden. Carried out far from the eyes of the Arkhalion state.

## BreakPoint Event

The Breakpoint was a cataclysmic, reality-shattering event that altered the course of galactic history. It began as a highly classified experiment conducted in secret by the Interplanetary Wizarding Organization (IWO) on Arkhalion Prime — an attempt to fold space-time and create compressed corridors that would drastically reduce the time required for interstellar travel. Their ambition was not altruistic. With their influence waning in the face of technological progress, the IWO sought to reclaim power by becoming sole arbiters of deep-space transit. The result, however, was devastation.

Instead of opening a stable corridor, the experiment tore a wound into the very structure of reality. Through this rupture, an ancient cosmic force — later identified as Veyl — stirred and partially awakened. Scholars now believe Veyl is not a god in the traditional sense, but a primordial entity tied to the chaotic energy of the multiverse. It was not summoned deliberately, but rather brushed against, roused from its slumber by the unnatural compression of space and time.

Realizing too late what they had done, the IWO attempted to restrain the breach and suppress the entity’s entry into the material plane. In doing so, they wounded Veyl and entangled its essence in the unstable rift — creating a paradox: Veyl was neither fully in the universe, nor fully sealed away.

This failure became known as the Breakpoint — the moment when reality lost its certainty. The skies above Arkhalion Prime fractured. Dimensional tears erupted across the planet. Cities crumbled, divine energies destabilized, and from the rift surged creatures twisted by chaos, now known as riftborn. The north of Arkhalion Prime, where the experiment took place, was annihilated by the riftborn hordes. The south was not spared, but a portion endured. The IWO, partially responsible for the catastrophe, rallied survivors and arcane remnants to establish defensive efforts and coordinate retreat efforts. It was from these southern enclaves that expeditions were later launched to settle or reclaim nearby moons and planets in the system.

The effects of the Breakpoint rippled outward from Arkhalion Prime, with intensity proportional to distance from the origin. Nearby systems — particularly those lacking their own divine guardians or stable arcane defenses — experienced immediate collapse. Civilizations vanished to sovereign-class rift events. Further regions experienced more erratic consequences: warp anomalies, localized rift flares, and broken timelines. Though Arkhalion was not a dominant galactic force before the event, the damage was still universal in scope. IWO theorists now believe that worlds rich in latent ley energy, even far from Arkhalion Prime, were particularly vulnerable — as if the rupture found resonance in the places most saturated with arcane potential.

## Energy Systems

There are three primary forms of magical energy in the BreakPoint universe: Rift Energy, Divine Energy, and Ley Energy. These are not sources of sentient will or moral alignment, but rather natural forces that exist across space, planets, and celestial phenomena. Each energy type behaves differently, and their interactions shape much of the technological, magical, and political infrastructure in the modern galaxy.

While each can be harnessed in various ways, their behaviors and risks differ significantly. Energy types are not exclusive to any specific faction or character alignment — Rift Energy can be used for constructive purposes, and Divine Energy can be used by those with destructive intent.

The three types are as follows:

### **Rift Energy**

Rift energy is a corrosive, parasitic force that entered the known universe in the wake of Breakpoint. Unlike the ordered currents of ley or the belief-shaped power of divine energy, rift energy has no natural place in reality. It twists what already exists—corrupting biological forms, unraveling magical structures, and degrading technology. Its most terrifying trait is its tendency to reflect and distort: living beings exposed to rift energy are not randomly mutated but transformed in line with their most primal instincts, fears, or desires. Predators become hyper-aggressive, guardians become obsessed with control, and the ambitious often find themselves consumed by the very hunger that once drove them.

Where ley energy stabilizes and nourishes, rift energy accelerates entropy. Devices powered by rift-infused systems tend to overperform initially, delivering extreme results—but at the cost of structural collapse, system decay, or even user destabilization. Short-term power, long-term corrosion. Entire colonies powered by rogue rift reactors have reported structural failure within months or cognitive collapse among engineers working in close proximity. Rift energy is notoriously difficult to bind or store, and while some fringe researchers have created hybrid ley-rift tools, these prototypes are unstable at best and catastrophic at worst.

Rift energy is drawn to order. It gravitates most strongly toward areas of dense ley activity, where its chaotic nature can consume and corrupt structured flows of potential. Cities with high ley infrastructure or active spellwork face disproportionately high rates of rift activity, which is one of the many reasons the IWO developed the Warding Field technology. In contrast, divine energy repels rift influence to a degree—but only when actively invoked. Passive divine relics rarely provoke rift attention unless used in direct opposition to a break. In all respects, rift energy remains a threat: misunderstood, feared, and weaponized only by those willing to gamble with annihilation.

### **Divine Energy**

Unlike the other two forms, divine energy cannot be naturally harnessed within the fabric of space. For divine energy to be usable, it must be produced through the sentient belief of living beings. Gods do not create divine energy themselves; rather, they serve as conduits for the energy generated by those who revere, worship, or acknowledge them. The power of a divine being is directly proportional to the volume, focus, and intensity of belief directed toward them.

A core feature of divine energy is its dependence on locality. Because faith originates from specific populations in specific places, divine influence is strongest in areas where belief is most concentrated. A god may exist conceptually across the galaxy, but its actual ability to act in a given region is tethered to the degree of worship it receives there. This regional dependence means that a powerful divine presence on one world may be entirely powerless on another, even if it represents the same conceptual domain.

The identity of divine entities is not fixed. A single god may be known by different names, personalities, or interpretations depending on the culture that worships them. These differences are not merely cosmetic; they shape the powers and influence the god exhibits in each region. For example, the water goddess known as Myriel may manifest as a benevolent healing figure on a world rich in lakes and rivers, while the same domain of water might be personified as a destructive storm deity on a planet defined by oceanic tempests. This fragmented identity is not contradictory—each version draws from the same underlying divine thread but manifests according to the beliefs of those generating the energy.

A divine being is further limited by the expectations of its followers. Gods have limited power outside of the scope defined by their worshippers. This means that a god associated with wind and protection cannot perform acts of fire-based destruction unless its followers begin to perceive it as capable of such things. In cases where faith wanes, divine power fades accordingly. This was evident during the pre-Breakpoint era, when widespread trust in arcane mastery and technological progress made divine belief increasingly obsolete. Gods remained present, but inert. They were unable to affect the world in any meaningful way, and in some cases, were nearly forgotten. The Breakpoint, which brought catastrophic instability and shattered the foundations of civilization, marked the resurgence of belief and, with it, the return of divine strength. As people turned back to faith out of desperation, gods began to regain influence. This escalation culminated in the Divine Rift Wars, when divine beings once again became active participants in material conflicts.

In some cases, divine presence can be preserved even in areas where belief has diminished. Certain relics, temples, and sacred sites can act as storage vessels for divine resonance. These structures retain a portion of the energy once generated by worship and can be used to maintain a divine foothold even in the absence of a current following. Such relics are strategically important and often serve as centers of power or contested zones in regions where belief systems have shifted or collapsed.

### **Ley Energy**

Ley Energy is the latent potential energy found across the universe. While ambient throughout both planetary and interstellar environments, it is strongest near ley cores—dense natural nexuses of energy found deep beneath planetary crusts or embedded within massive celestial bodies. Unlike divine or rift energy, ley energy is inherently stable, reactive to intention, and non-sentient. It is this adaptability that makes it a cornerstone of elemental magic, spellcasting, enchantment, and passive enhancement.

However, direct manipulation of ley energy is not universally possible. Only a small percentage of the population — typically estimated between 1% and 2% — are born with innate ley attunement, a trait believed to be genetic, though not perfectly inheritable. These individuals, known in some cultures as Channelers, Wielders, or Leyborn, are capable of interfacing with ambient ley currents and shaping them through conscious thought, emotional resonance, and structured technique.

Because of this innate exclusivity, ley-capable individuals occupy a distinct — and often contentious — place in society. In some cultures, they are elevated as natural elites, trained from youth and placed in positions of leadership or military service. In others, they are distrusted, closely regulated, or even ostracized. 

Most formal institutions across Arkhalion and its satellites have developed ley academies, where attuned individuals receive structured training. These institutions focus on emotion regulation, sigil theory, elemental focus, and ley discipline — necessary tools for preventing instability or harm. Even among the attuned, mastery is rare. Untrained ley wielders are considered dangerous, and unsanctioned use is regulated by city-level or alliance-wide magical law.

Technology remains relevant in part because ley manipulation is rare. To bridge the gap, magi-tech engineering has become widespread — devices powered by ley-infused batteries or ambient siphoning mechanisms, usable by non-wielders. While these devices cannot match the raw adaptability of a trained leyborn, they provide a critical interface between civilian life and magic.

Ley energy cannot be stored, channeled, or conducted through standard metals, plastics, or synthetic materials. Instead, it requires specialized conduits composed of rare, ley-reactive crystalline ores. The most well-known of these is Auralite, a mineral found near ley cores or within collapsed leywells deep in planetary crusts. These materials must be carefully refined and tuned, a process that demands precision arcane engineering and makes leytech production expensive and tightly controlled.

Even once refined, ley energy poses challenges during implementation. High-tier devices require individualized harmonization, often through ritual binding, emotion-matching, or a sigil-based imprint. This prevents high-efficiency leytech from being mass-produced at scale — most high-performance ley gear is artisanal, calibrated to a specific user or crafted under the guidance of a ley-channeling specialist. As a result, lower-grade devices are more common in civilian sectors, powered by simple ley capacitors or ambient siphons.

Furthermore, ley saturation caps place limits on how much power a device can hold or channel at once. Leytech tools, weapons, and constructs will degrade or destabilize if exposed to continuous overload without a recharge period or proper insulation. Most field-grade items include shielding enchantments or pressure valves to bleed off excess energy, but high-tier ley weapons require dedicated recharge stations or ley-born technicians for sustained use.

## Bounded and Unbounded Areas

Following the chaos of Breakpoint and the ensuing Divine Rift Wars, one of the most important stabilizing innovations of the post-cataclysmic era was the development of Warding Fields — large-scale containment wards designed by the IWO to reduce the volatility of raw energy expression in inhabited regions.

Known colloquially as bounded zones or simply “the bounds,” these protective fields serve as a city’s first line of energetic regulation. Their function is straightforward: to suppress ambient and directed magical energies within a defined area, limiting the destructive potential of high-energy beings, technologies, and anomalies.

### **Function and Structure**

The Warding Field suppresses all three known energy types — rift, divine, and ley — and dampens their manifestation in both passive and active forms. This applies to magical constructs, elemental projection, teleportation, sustained flight, and other high-energy phenomena. While physical enhancements (such as biologically augmented strength or durability) are mostly unaffected, energy-based abilities are significantly weakened inside the bounds.

### **Design and Infrastructure**

Warding Fields are powered by anchor structures distributed across the protected zone — towers, pylons, or ley-reactive nodes that draw enormous amounts of energy to sustain the field. These systems scale exponentially in cost and power requirements:

The current theoretical maximum contiguous Warding Field size is 10,000 km². In cases where a second field must be placed nearby, it must be at least 200 km from the edge of the first to prevent overlap interference or sympathetic disruption. The largest constructed warding field is in Cindralith Alpha, a little under 5000km^2.

Due to the immense energy demand, most cities opt for bounded zones of manageable scale, often surrounding city centers, government sectors, and key infrastructure and housing — not entire continents.

### **Field Tuning and Energy Balance**

While all energy types are suppressed as a baseline, cities may tune their fields to emphasize suppression of specific energy categories. A scientific research district may allow greater ley throughput, while a military stronghold may heavily suppress rift energy but permit divine channels for tactical use.

Suppressing energies beyond practical thresholds risks field instability, requiring constant recalibration and risking arcane surges. Additionally, over-suppression can harm a city’s infrastructure — much of which integrates rift-powered or ley-reliant technology with short-range applications (e.g., public transit nodes, shielding arrays, distributed storage systems).
