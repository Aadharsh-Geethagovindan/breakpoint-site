## Appendix A: IWO Standards For RiftBorn Classes

| Class | Class Range System | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Sovereign | 1-3 | Essences of Veyl Itself. They operate on a level similar to gods. Their presence in material space is sporadic |
| Apex | 1-4 | Catastrophic threat. Class 1’s Equivalent to divine beings in raw power. |
| Goliath | 1-4 | Massive and highly destructive, requiring heavy weaponry or specialized tactics to take down. Class 1s give CAF Vanguards trouble. |
| Mainline | 1-6 | Typical rift monsters. Dangerous individually; deadly in groups.  |
| Lesser | 1-5 | Small-scale, swarm-type entities. Used in disruption or spread. |
| Aberrant | 1-5 | Mutated or unique riftforms. May fall between categories; require specialized analysis. |

## Appendix B: IWO Standards for Riftbreak Classes

The Intergalactic Wizarding Organization (IWO) developed the Riftborn Classification Standard as a means of unifying rift threat identification across the galaxy. First formalized in 251 AB and continuously revised since, the system is now used by the Constellian Alliance, IWO field teams, planetary defense forces, and most recognized military or research institutions.

This classification system is split into two tiers of analysis:

* **Class**: Indicates the general threat category of a riftborn based on size, durability, destructive capability, and anomaly signature. From the smallest swarming creatures to god-tier sovereigns, this label allows immediate triage of a rift entity's potential.

* **Range**: A numerical sub-rating (1–5 or 1–6 depending on class) used to distinguish relative danger within the same class. For example, a Goliath-Class 1 riftbeast is significantly more dangerous than a Goliath-Class 4 — though both are broadly categorized as large, battlefield-shifting entities.

**Note**: In the IWO system, **Range 1** denotes the most dangerous version within a class. A lower number always indicates higher threat within that classification.

This standard enables rapid calibration of military response levels and containment procedures. It also allows cross-faction forces to speak with **shared clarity** when reporting, mobilizing, or escalating encounters with unknown rift entities.

| Class | Designation | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| S | Sovereign Break | Involves a Sovereign-class entity. Global threat. Requires divine or Primarch-level response. Often occurs in conjunction with multiple Class A breaks |
| A | Apex Break | Typically spawns 1–2 Apex-class entities and numerous Goliath-class threats. Demands full Constellian or IWO deployment. |
| B | Major Break | Multiple Goliath-class and high-count Mainline-class riftbeasts. Threatens regional stability. |
| C | Moderate Break | Mainline-class riftbeasts in medium numbers. Requires military intervention but not galactic assets. |
| D | Minor Break | Small swarms of lesser riftbeasts. Can be managed by local planetary forces. |
| E | Contained Breach | Spatial portals that can be created for movement. Rift Induction Chambers in Spaceships make these to move across star systems |
